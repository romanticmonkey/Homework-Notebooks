    "# Week 2 - Counting Words & Phrases\n",
    "\n",
    "This week, we take text corpora that we have developed, spidered, scraped, and encoded, and we find and count words, simple and parsed phrases and explore the statistical properties of those counts (e.g., word frequency distributions). Initially, we model how to search corpora for keywords or phrases. Next, we examine the distributions of terms and phrases across a corpus, and the correlation between different words and phrase counts. In order to do this effectively, we coarsely disambiguate words based of part-of-speech (POS) tagging, and normalize them through stemming and lemmatization. Next we distinguish *important* words and phrase within the corpus, and image them with Wordls! Then we calculate word frequenceis, conditional frequences (the frequency of word *shock* conditional on the presence of word *awe*), and statistically significant collocations of lengths 2 through $n$. Finally, we calculate and visualize Differences (Divergences and Distances) between the word frequency distributions from two corpora. \n",
    "\n",
    "Then we shift to focus not simply on the *ideas* in a corpus, but also extracting precise *claims*. This process involves a sequential pipeline of classifying and structuring tokens from text, each of which generates potentially useful data for the content analyst. Steps in this process, which we examine in this notebook, include: 1) tagging words by their part of speech (POS) to reveal the linguistic role they play in the sentence (e.g., Verb, Noun, Adjective, etc.); 2) tagging words as named entities (NER) such as places or organizations; 3) structuring or \"parsing\" sentences into nested phrases that are local to, describe or depend on one another; and 4) extracting informational claims from those phrases.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be introducing spaCy as a package for Computational Linguistics, and also walk you through how to use the Davies Corpora. \n",
    "\n",
    "While we wish to avoid using NLTK for heavy corpus analysis, some of its smaller functions can still be useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, for final projects that draw on these tools, we encourage you to install the software on your own machines or shared servers at the university (RCC, SSRC) in order to perform these operations on much more text. \n",

    "For this notebook we will be using the following packages:\n"

They do in families @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , not that you \\'d have brains enough to know it ... but I \\'ve been a pretty good brother to you , see ? I \\'ve been a father and a mother to ya . I \\'m supporting this house . And you \\'ve got some nerve comin \\' in at 4:00 in the morning ... tellin \\' me that you \\'re gon na get married . Why do you object ? You do n\\'t even know the fella . No , but I \\'m going to . Bring him around . Let him meet your family , like any decent fella would want to do . And after a while , if I think he \\'s all right ... you can marry him . - After a while ? - Oh , that gets a rise out of you , does it ? I thought it would . One of them rush marriages . - What do you mean ? - You know what I mean . - You do n\\'t know that I did anything wrong . - I can put two and two together . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You can prove that you \\'re not . You tell me that you \\'ll wait , or I \\'ll know that you got ta marry this guy . And if that \\'s the case , I do n\\'t want you in the house . - Now , what do you think about that ? - Where \\'ll I go ? Go back where you come from , you little tramp . And get out now . You wo n\\'t take any clothes with you either . I paid for every rag you got on your back . Go on . Get out . You deserve everything you \\'re gettin \\' . Sure does . A girl brought up under the influence of a fine brother like you got . You \\'ll probably end up in the streets . That \\'s what you got in your mind , ai n\\'t it , Jim ? And I wo n\\'t be sorry for her either . No , I do n\\'t expect you to be sorry for her , Jim . But let her have her clothes . - I paid for \\' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Let her find out there ai n\\'t another man who \\'ll treat her as white as her own brother did . Go on . Let her have her clothes . All right . Get \\' em , and get out . Hey , Dot . Hey . - Where you goin \\' ? - With the kid , you big bully . You called her a tramp , did n\\'t ya ? Just because she stayed out until 4:00 in the morning and you suspect where she was . Well , I stayed out until 4:00 in the morning , and you knew where I was . So I got a pretty good idea what you think of me . I \\'ll see you in the cemetery . Go on , Dot . Wake up , Dotty . Wake up . Hello , Floyd . Ma just hollered across the air shaft ... and said that she was makin \\' breakfast for a new bride . Are you a new bride ? Yes , darling . I \\'m going to be today . - What \\'s an old one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on . Run along and play now . Aw , I wan na see Dotty get out of bed . You get out of here . I wan na see Dotty get out of bed . And at his age . - What time is it ? - Almost 11:00 . - I phoned the store and said we were both sick . - Has Eddie come yet ? - Nope . - He has n\\'t ? - Not yet . - I wonder why he does n\\'t come . - Maybe it \\'s \\' cause he does n\\'t know I \\'m here . - That \\'d be a good reason . He certainly would n\\'t come to see me . Oh , he does n\\'t really dislike you , Edna . No , not dislike . He hates me . And it is n\\'t just an average , everyday , amateur kind of hatred either . I \\'ll bet that guy spends hours practicing hating me . Aw , that \\'s just his way . You know , he \\'s kind of funny . That would be great . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , gee , Edna , it was swell the way you came through for me last night . - I \\'m awful grateful to ya . - And I \\'m grateful toJim . - He saved my life . - How ? Just suppose he did n\\'t turn out to be a heel last night . I \\'d have been married to him in three months , and after being nicely cemented ... with a wedding ring , the church service and everything ... I \\'d have found out what he really is . Yes , sir . He saved my life- \\' cause they send you to the chair these days for killing your husband . In the name of goodness , what are you doing ? - I \\'m trying something , but it wo n\\'t work . - What wo n\\'t ? I put some black ink in the white milk ... and the white milk turned black . But when I put the white milk in the black ink , the black wo n\\'t turn white . Put that ink away and clean up that mess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what time Is It now ? It \\'s a little after 11:00 . - Where \\'d you put my stockings ? - Why , I put \\' em , uh-Is this Mrs . Cook \\'s boardinghouse ? Well , is Mr . Collins there ? Collins . Eddie Collins . He what ? He moved away ? Well-Well , he lived there last night . He moved away this morning ? Well-Well , did he say where he was moving to ?

Schuyler 4-6583 . Schuyler 4-6583 . And hurry it up , deary . There \\'s a fire . Here . Hello ? Hello , Lathrop Radio Shop ? Well , can I speak to Mr . Collins , please ? Eddie Collins . Never mind the wisecracks . He \\'s there , I wan na speak to him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to . Fresh guy trying to flirt with me . He what ? He was fired ? What for ? He said he was fired for robbin \\' the cash register . Well , you \\'re all right then . If he \\'s lost his job , it \\'s a cinch he \\'ll be here to marry ya . I ca n\\'t tell whether the fella was kiddin \\' or not . There he is now . See ? All of your troubles for nothing . Oh , gee , and I \\'m not dressed or anything . Oh , give me those stockings . I do n\\'t wan na subscribe to any magazines . I do n\\'t care if you \\'re working your way through the penitentiary . - Was that him , Edna ? - No . A book agent . Oh . What am I gon na do ? Now , stop worrying . If Eddie is only half the guy I think he is , he wo n\\'t let you down . That \\'s the trouble with us women . If we \\'d only realize that-Something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? - I \\'m cookin \\' it for ya . - A whole pound of butter . I told you a piece of butter , not a pound of butter . A pound \\'s a piece . I \\'ll go , Edna . Oh , darling , you \\'re driving me crazy . Get out into the hall . You \\'ve done all the damage in here that you can . See if you can ruin the wallpaper . - Shall I do it with a knife ? - Get out of here ! - Was n\\'t him , huh ? - No . A man selling-For goodness \\' sake , take that long face off . This is your wedding day , not your funeral . He \\'ll be here . There \\'s a mistake somewhere . That \\'s all . Yeah , last night- that was the mistake . Do n\\'t be silly . He \\'ll be here . Oh , but I love him so much . Well , you can still love him and have a cup of coffee in your stomach too . I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything again . - Fine . Then have a glass of milk . - I do n\\'t want any milk . Oh , come on . Have a glass of milk . It \\'ll do you good . You know , the first thing that you have to learn is-I \\'m getting hysterical . Open the door , Floyd . And if it \\'s a man selling coffins , tell him we \\'ll take two . Who \\'s dead ? Oh , Eddie ! - What \\'s the matter ? - Nothing . Say , listen . You \\'re going to be a married man . The first thing you have to learn is to get accustomed to your wife \\'s tears . I was over to your house , and they said you was n\\'t there . So I took a chance and come here . I called up your house , and your landlady said that you \\'d moved . I got a bigger room across the street . My landlady was sore . That \\'s why she would n\\'t tell you where I went . And they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stealing . They were kidding \\' ya . Oh , Eddie , I \\'m so happy . - Okay . - Now maybe you can eat some breakfast . We \\'ll eat downtown . We got ta get goin \\' . Go get your things . Her master \\'s voice . - Do you know how to get there ? - I \\'ll find out . - I \\'ll tell ya . You take the subway to City Hall . - Yeah ? When you get out of the train , you walk straight ahead and turn to the right . There are two exits there . You take the one to the left . Understand ? - Yeah . - Then when you get up on the street ... - you walk straight ahead-- I \\'m gon na take a cab . I \\'ll tell you which cab to take . Hey . Whose wedding is this , yours or mine ? Oh , Edna \\'s just trying to help us , Eddie . You was n\\'t on the other side when they had the war , were ya @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was wondering how they ever got along without you . I phoned my orders over . Wo n\\'t you come down and see us get married ? No . I hate those things- deaths and funerals and things like that . Oh , gee , Edna . I can never thank you enough for all you \\'ve done for me . Oh , that \\'s all right , kid . I only hope you \\'re gon na be awful happy . If she ai n\\'t , you \\'ll hear from me , you big stiff . Okay . - Good luck . - So long . Good-bye . Oh , darling ! Night , now . - Hello , darling . - Hello . - What \\'s this ? - Oh . Just a couple of hunks of candy . Oh , gee , Eddie . - You know why ? - Sure . Because you love me , do n\\'t ya ?

Aw , gee , it was sweet of you to bring me the candy . And I got news for ya . I found a store . The boss is gon na lend me a hundred bucks ... and with the 650 I got saved up , I can swing the deal . He \\'ll let me have all the radios I want on time . - What do you know about that , huh ? - That \\'ll be swell . Of course , we may have to pinch nickels for a while but ... in the end , it \\'ll all be jake . - Gee whiz , I \\'m a happy guy . - Are you , Eddie ? Yeah . I been thinkin \\' about having my own store for over two years now . And while I ai n\\'t much on tossing \\' this baloney ... and all that mush stuff ... a guy could have a worse wife than you . - Ya little squirt . - Oh , Eddie . - I love you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your hat and coat on , and I \\'ll take you over and show you the place . - Oh , I ca n\\'t now . - Why not ? I \\'m waitin \\' for Edna . She phoned she \\'ll be up in a little while . - Ah , what does she want ? - Well , I wanted to ask her advice about something . - About what ? - About-Well , about the store , see what she thinks of it . Oh , gee . It \\'ll be tough if she do n\\'t like it . Oh , Eddie , that \\'s not a nice thing to say . Here she is . Now , please do n\\'t be mean to her . Come in . - Hello , Dot . - HI , Edna . How \\'s the grouch ? I thought they sent you down to Washington ... so you could tell the president how to run the country . Ooh . They sent the president up to see me . Oh , do n\\'t mind him , Edna . - He \\'s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looks it . - He \\'s gon na open his own store soon . - Hmm ! I heard Wanamaker \\'s were going out of business . They probably figured the competition would be too much for \\' em . I \\'m going down to the corner and get a paper . Come on . Sit down . I \\'ve got so much to tell you . - Still in love with him ? - Oh , I \\'m just crazy about him . Edna , I \\'m going to have a baby . Oh , Dot . - I \\'m afraid . - Oh , do n\\'t be silly . - My mother had eight of_\\'em . - Yeah . My mother died having me . Yes , but things are different now . You know , the hospitals are better , and the doctors and things . No girl minds it anymore . - What does Eddie say ? - He does n\\'t know . Well , why do n\\'t you tell him ? Well , his heart \\'s so set on having that store . It \\'ll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n\\'t know what to do . Edna , I \\'m so worried . You know , if the store \\'s gon na make Eddie happy , I want him to have it . - Sure . - When I think of what happened to my mother-Unless I had everything of the best- you know , the best doctors and everything-- I \\'d be frightened . - You poor kid . Now listen . This fella you \\'re married to is all right . He \\'s 100 ? /o . I know what \\'s the matter with him . He \\'s one of those sensitive eggs . Of course , he may not like me , but what the heck . Napol ? on had a couple of enemies too . Now you tell Eddie tonight . And if I know anything about men ... he \\'ll be stopping strangers on the street tomorrow , bragging about it . - Do you really think so ? - Oh , sure . All men are alike . They puff themselves up . You \\'d think they \\'d done something . - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . - He will be . I do n\\'t know though . He \\'s always yelling about living in a tenement ... and what a sin it is to have children if you ca n\\'t afford to give \\' em everything . I do n\\'t think I read anything in the papers about him being born in the White House . He was awful poor . That \\'s why he thinks like that about it . Here he is . Do n\\'t say anything . - You still here ? - No . Dld you get your paper , Eddle ? I got down there , and I did n\\'t have any change . You can get one next week . They \\'ll have a dozen new murders for you by then . Here , let me fix that tie . - It looks like a unbent pretzel . - The tie is-You only wear it . Other people have to look at it . I do n\\'t know how you ever picked this jane out for a friend . - She \\'s the dizziest dame I ever seen . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Eddie . Look what I got ! Look what I got ! - Where \\'d you get all this stuff ? - Eddie give us 60 cents to buy it . Aw , he \\'s crazy . It was - Sixty-Oh , what did you wan na come up here for anyway ? Go on outside and play . Go on . Go on . Go on now . Get out of here . Thanks a lot , Eddie ! Gim me a slice of that cone down there . Poor kids . I found \\' em downstairs in that dark hallway tryin \\' to play games . They ai n\\'t got a chance in life . Eddie , did you give him the 60 cents ? Listen , I got better things to do with my money ... than throw it away on a lot of kids . Say , you \\'re a swell egg . What are you gon na sell in your radio store ? Never mind . The way you run people \\'s business for them ... if you start butting \\' in , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , I \\'m going . - Remember now . Tell him . - Tell him what ? Oh , nothing , Eddie . She \\'s got a secret for ya . Oh , she \\'s got a secret for me , but you know it . Geez , you \\'re runnin \\' my house for me , too , I see . - Sure . Bye , darlin \\' . - See you tomorrow . - Bye , grouch . - So long , dizzy . - What \\'s the big secret ? - I do n\\'t know whether you \\'ll like it or not . Hey , listen , kid . I \\'m so happy about the store , I \\'d like anything . Oh . Well ? What is it ? Eddie , I \\'m going back to work . - Back to work ? - Yeah . Hey , listen . No wife of mine is goin \\' to work . - What \\'d be the harm ? - I \\'ll do all the work that \\'s to be done in this family . - What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well-Well , it gets kind of lonesome staying \\' here all day all alone . Ca n\\'t you go to picture shows and things ? You just said we \\'d have to pinch nickels . Yeah , but I did n\\'t mean we \\'d have to pinch \\' em that hard . - You do n\\'t like livin \\' in just one room . Is that it ? - Oh , it \\'s all right . But I wish we had a flat of our own or something-you know , our own furniture . Ca n\\'t you see , Eddie ? If I went to work , you could have your store just the same . And with the money I make , we could-Do you think I \\'d take money you worked for ? - Oh , it \\'d be all right . - Not with me , it would n\\'t . My idea of a husband is a guy that looks after his wife and takes care of her ... and sees that she do n\\'t want for nothin \\' . If I ca n\\'t do that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money- you work all day- or let you use it for something that I ought to be payin \\' for . Listen . They got a name for guys like that . Oh , Eddie , I did n\\'t mean to make you sore . I ai n\\'t sore . But I ai n\\'t as happy as I was . You can lay that on a line . It was our 10 weeks anniversary . And I had the store all picked out and everything . And , say , when I come in here tonight , I was walkin \\' on air . This kinda crumbs it all up . Gee , I did n\\'t know you was n\\'t satisfied . Oh , Eddie , I am satisfied . It \\'s all right . Let \\'s not talk about it . - I \\'ll bet that Edna jane put that idea in your nut . - No , she did n\\'t . Let \\'s not say any more about it . You \\'re crazy to have the store , and it \\'ll make you happy . Well , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I \\'m the husband , and it \\'s my job to make you happy . If a husband ai n\\'t for that , he ai n\\'t for nothin \\' . Gee , I told the real estate guy I \\'d meet him tonight . I ca n\\'t make up my mind about that sign . \\' \\' Eddie Collins \" or \\' \\' Edward Collins \" ? Course , \\' \\' Eddie Collins \" is all right for a saloon or somethin \\' like that . Nope , it ai n\\'t got class enough for a radio store . I \\'ll be back in 15 or 20 minutes . And I still think that Edna jane put that idea in your nut . I was afraid you was n\\'t comin \\' . What \\'s the idea of phoning \\' me to meet you here ? - Dot and me are movin \\' here . - You \\'re movin \\' here ? Sure . I got new furniture and everything . That \\'s why I asked you to come . I thought maybe you \\'d help me put \\' em @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in anyway , so I figured out you might as well do it in the beginning . You \\'re moving here ? Yeah . Dot told me that secret . What \\'s that got to do with your moving and spending your money ? She wanted to go to work . - You mean that \\'s the secret she told you ? - Yeah . So I put two and two together and figured out why . She wanted a home with nice furnishings and things . - Say , how much did all this cost you ? - I shot the bankroll . - Oh , no . - Yeah . - All you \\'d saved ? - Sure . This is a swell joint . The furniture man is takin \\' charge . I bought everything new- from soup to nuts . When it \\'s finished , it \\'ll look just like a home that somebody \\'s lived in for a long time . Some surprise for the kid , huh ? Yeah , but what about your store ? Well , I figured , why let her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ build up a business ? I might \\'ve made a flop of the store anyhow . Not that I would \\'ve . I \\'d have made a success of it . Do n\\'t get that idea in your nut . And you spent all your savings ? Sure . She \\'s worth it . She \\'s a great kid . You \\'ll have me crying in a minute , Eddie . What for ? You would n\\'t know . Come on . You never saw anything sweller than that parlor set I bought . Come on . Wait till you get a load of the bedroom . It \\'s got sheets and pillowcases and beds and everything in it . And the kitchen- We got a lot of pots and pans . It \\'s gon na be like a party . See , I \\'m gon na tell Dot that Pat and Sue have got a new flat ... and are havin \\' a housewarming and we \\'re invited . I asked a lot of the gang , and they \\'re in on it too . It \\'s gon na @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parties . And the big payoff comes when I say ... \\' \\' Well , kid , how do you like your new home ? \" What do you think of the idea ? - I do n\\'t know . - You did n\\'t think it up . That \\'s why . Hey , wait a minute . Do n\\'t put that great big chair over there by the divan . - That \\'s where the chair belongs . - No , it is n\\'t . It belongs over on this side . Have n\\'t you got any sense of balance ? - You would get your mouth in it some way or another . dd Hey , hey . Wait until they get here . Aw , have a heart . I have n\\'t had any supper . And do n\\'t drink up all the punch . Here they are . Listen , Pat . Remember , this is supposed to be your home . You \\'re the host . - Right . I \\'ll take off my coat and collar . - That ai n\\'t funny . - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door . Go on . I did n\\'t even know that Pat had moved from 92nd Street . Sure . They got a swell place here . - Hello , Dot . How are you ? - Hello , Sue . - Hello , Eddie . - I did n\\'t know that you \\'d moved . Oh , I \\'ve been here a week . Come in . Hi , everybody . - Hello , Chad . How are you ? - Hello , Dot . - Hello , Pat . How are you ? - Let me take your coat . - Have a schnapps . - Oh , no , thanks . Oh , gee , Sue , this is swell . Pat must have murdered a millionaire or something . Hey , you ai n\\'t seen nothin \\' yet . Come on out here and I \\'ll show you the kitchen . You \\'d think this was his house . Come on . Let \\'s eat . A closet , and it \\'s got glass in it too . And a sink and a washtub . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where you keep your salt and pepper and spices and things . In the one marked \\' \\' Salt , \" you keep the salt . In the one marked \\' \\' Pepper , \" you keep the pepper . Gee , Eddie , ai n\\'t it swell ? Look at that darling table . The guy said it was the breakfast nook . Oh , Eddie , you think we \\'ll ever have a place like this ? - Would you like to live here , kid ? - Oh , gee , would I ? - Of course , we could n\\'t afford-- Why not ? Well , we could n\\'t afford the money now . Well , why now ? - Well , you wan na get your store first . - Yeah . Oh , yeah . That \\'s right . Say , wait till you get a load of the bedroom . Come on ! Say , if Eddie can get Dot a home like this , why ca n\\'t you get me one ? I thought that \\'d crop up . - Look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , kid . There \\'s a bed . You ca n\\'t buy a better bed than that- 65 bucks . - But how did you-- Oh , Pat told me . Come on . Feel it . Just feel it . Ai n\\'t this a bed ? Not like that old egg crate we sleep in . I \\'ve never seen you so enthusiastic . The house has sure made a hit with you . Come on . Now I \\'m gon na show you somethin \\' . Just grand . There \\'s the bridges over there . And there \\'s all New York to pick from . Ai n\\'t the lights great ? And the East River . And stars . Are n\\'t they beautiful ? Not phony one\\'s either . Gee , a roof like this would be a swell place for ... kids to play . Would n\\'t it , Eddie ? You know , they could get plenty of fresh air ... and their mothers would n\\'t have to worry about streetcars ... and taxis and trucks and things . You know , rich kids could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , do n\\'t you , kid ? Oh , I think it \\'s just grand . I \\'m awful glad for Pat and Sue . Okay . We better get back to the bunch now . You said it . Sue , it \\'s the grandest flat I ever saw . - I \\'m awfully glad you like it , Dot . - Oh , it \\'s sweet for anything . Dot , sit down . Here goes . Well , kid , it \\'s yours . - Mine ? What do you mean , mine ? - Sure . Yours . This is where you \\'re gon na live . I bought it for you . - You bought it for me ? - Sure . You know that secret about goin \\' back to work ? Well , I doped it out that you was n\\'t satisfied where you \\'re livin \\' . So this is the answer . - Well , what about your store ? - Thls Is It . You spent all your money for this ? I shot the works . - You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n\\'t owe a nickel on It . Well , what do ya say ? I do n\\'t know . Do n\\'t seem to make such a hit with ya now . Naturally , Eddie . She \\'s surprised . You ca n\\'t get a thing like this through your head in a minute . - Did you know he was doing it , Edna ? - Yeah , I helped him fi ? x It up . Why \\'d you let him spend all the money ? Well , folks , it looks like a bust . Oh , no , it is n\\'t , Eddie . I think it \\'s just great . I \\'m tickled to death . - You \\'re the swellest husband any girl ever had . - Okay . Dot \\'s only disappointed for you , Eddie . She was so anxious for you to have the store ... she did n\\'t want you to spend the money for anything else . - That \\'s right . - Sure . That \\'s why , dear . You know I think it \\'s just swell . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a long time dead . Live while ya can . That \\'s what I say . When I think of the way my folks used to live . They did n\\'t have enough money to support themselves ... so they go and have nine kids . My old lady used to scrub floors in an office building . 4:00 every morning she went to work- sick or well , summer or winter . I can see her goin\\'out when It was 20 below zero ... with a cough that \\'d tear the heart out of ya . And for what ? To bring up a couple ofklds and die- dle before they was ever any comfort to her . Not for Dot . Every nickel I make , she and I are gon na spend on ourselves . - My sister died bringing up-- Oh , stop it ! Ca n\\'t you stop it ! You \\'d think there was nothin \\' else in the world to talk about . All right . There , there , dear . Shh . What \\'s wrong ? Dot \\'s going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Eddle . No , she \\'s just a little hysterical . That \\'s all . We should n\\'t have talked about those things . - That \\'s right . I guess we shouldn\\'t . - Sue told me , but I forgot . Gee , everybody in New York seems to know about it ... but the only guy that \\'s interested . Oh , gee , Eddie , I wish you \\'d let me do that . Do n\\'t be crazy , will ya ? You \\'re goin \\' to the hospital in a few weeks . You know the doc told you not to do any hard work . I do n\\'t think he knows what he \\'s talkin \\' about . I do n\\'t like him . - You want me to get you a different one ? - No . If you ca n\\'t get the best , he \\'s as good as any of the others , I guess . He \\'s all right . I worry . That \\'s all . - About what ? - About everything . You having to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pinching \\' every nickel the way you have . I do n\\'t want a baby any more than you do . All right , all right . Now you told me that a thousand times . Let \\'s not talk about it . Is there any other doctor you got in mind ? There was somethin \\' in the paper about a society woman . The doctor \\'s name was Burgess . His picture was there . Gee , he was awful kind-lookin \\' . Not that we could get him . He \\'s only for millionaires . As long as you ca n\\'t get him , you might as well pick out the best . Whoo-ooh ! Dot ! Now do n\\'t bring her in here . I do n\\'t want her razzin \\' me . - Good morning . - Hello , Edna . - Hello , Eddie . - So long . Floyd made such a racket , I did n\\'t wait for breakfast . - Got a cup of coffee ? - Sure . Hmm . You got a new washerwoman , I see . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n\\'t got enough bluing in this water . I knew somethin \\' would be wrong with it when you seen it . - Here . - Thanks . Got a cigarette ? No , I cut \\' em out . They was puttin \\' my throat on the bum . Come on , Edna . Drink this in the other room . Yeah , go on . Beat it , will ya ? You give me the willies . That \\'s good . - How do you feel ? - Oh , all right . - How do you feel when you feel bad ? - I worry . Yeah , and you worry other people too . You worry him . Your child \\'ll probably grow up to be a radio broadcaster . Gee , It \\'s 10 minutes to 8 . ? 00 . I got ta blow . Do n\\'t touch those things . I \\'ll finish \\' em when I come home . - Good-bye , darling . - So long . - So long , meddlesome . - Good-bye , grouch . Break a leg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me so miserable . - What ? - He \\'s so square about everything . Says smoking hurts his throat . He cut it out so he could save the money . It does n\\'t seem fair that he should give up all his fun just because of me . Yeah , it \\'s tough on husbands . Nobody knows what a husband suffers when his wife has a baby ... and a big juicy raspberry . It must be great for a woman when everything is right- you know , when she can afford a doctor like that man Burgess ... and when she knows her husband wants the baby . You want it , do n\\'t you , Dot ? I \\'m crazy about it . That is , I would be ... if it were n\\'t for Eddie and if I was n\\'t afraid . - How do you know he does n\\'t want it ? - The things he says . I can feel it , too , in the way he acts . He does n\\'t like children . Coochie-coo . Coochie-coo . Coochie , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ? - Only seven months . Of course , all parents are proud of their children . But honestly , even if this was somebody else \\'s kid ... I \\'d have to admit it \\'s the cleverest youngster I ever saw . - Do n\\'t you think so , Mama ? - I honestly do . Hey , lookit ! The little son of a gun \\'s got ahold of my finger . That \\'s what I mean . Is n\\'t that clever ? - She \\'s a darling . Look at her . - Coochie-coo . Coochie-coo . Coochie , coochie-coo . Coochie-coo . Coochie-coo . Hey , Eddie . Eddie . Eddie . - Has Mr . Randall \\'s set been fixed for him ? - Yes , sir . - Gee , that \\'s a great kid you got . - We think so . - Say , Mr . Lathrop ? - Yes ? Do you think that a woman havin \\' a baby ... you know , that she has n\\'t always wanted ... could-could learn to love it ... you know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Your wife , eh ? She \\'s afraid . Say , there ai n\\'t any danger in these things , is there ? Well , lots of women manage to have babies ... without calling out the militia . There \\'s no danger when they have the proper attention . She should be made to have confidence in her doctor . That \\'s just it . My wife ai n\\'t got any . That \\'s not right . - She speaks of a Dr . Burgess . - Burgess ? You \\'d have to be a millionaire to have him . - Goin \\' to lunch , Eddie ? - Nah , I cut lunches out . I was gettin \\' too fat . - This Dr . Burgess is good , huh ? - And expensive . When a king is born , they send for him . I wonder how you could get in to see a guy like that . - Mr . Lathrop , will you take a look at this set , please ? - Oh , yes . Certainly . Hey , Joe . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Club ? - Yeah . Do you suppose he could get me on in one of them preliminary fights ? Say , some of those boys are pretty good . - What do you wan na take a beatin \\' for ? - Ten bucks a round . Four rounds- 40 bucks . I can use that dough swell . - I can fix it for ya , but I think you \\'re nutty . - Okay . 7:00 . Say , ai n\\'t that job of yours got any hours ? A guy wanted his radio fixed , so I did it on the side . I should think you \\'d try gettin \\' home ... with your wife goin \\' to the hospital and everything . - How is she ? - She \\'s worrying herself sick . That \\'s how she is . But , gee , she ought n\\'t to do that . I do n\\'t think she knows that . You ought to tell her . - You had any supper ? - I ai n\\'t hungry . Gettin \\' your beauty sleep , kid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would hurt you to hang around once in a while . Okay . That \\' \\' okay \" does me a lot of good , do n\\'t it ? Gee , kid , you know I \\'m for you , do n\\'t ya ? Well , it do n\\'t look like it . You have n\\'t spent an evening in the house for two weeks now . I do n\\'t mean to be a grouch , Eddie , but ... I \\'m frightened . Is it the doctor ? Is that what makes you afraid ? Oh , he \\'s all right , I guess . It \\'s my fault . You know , you have confidence in some people , and others you have n\\'t . There \\'s no reason . You just have . That \\'s all . Sure , I know how it is , kid . Eddie , you \\'re gon na stick around and go to the hospital with me tonight , ai n\\'t ya ? You betcha . No . Wait a minute . - I tell ya , I got ta go out-- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - Oh , no . Just for a half an hour , kid . - Ca n\\'t even stay with me tonight . I \\'ll be right back . Honest I will . Mmm . Your honey is searching among the \\' \\' bees . \" Hello ? Yeah , this is his secretary . Mm-hmm . Who wants to talk to him ? Joe ? - There \\'s a Joe wants to talk to you . - Hello , Joe . Tonight ? Sure I \\'ll be there . Hey , that \\'s great . It comes just at the right time . Thanks . So long . I \\'ll be a little longer now , but I \\'ll be back at 9:00 . I got another fella to see now . - You pick a swell night to make a date . - You sure do . This ai n\\'t a date . Honest it ain\\'t . - I \\'ll be back as quick as I can . - Give my love toJenny , will ya ? - WhatJenny ? - WhateverJenny happens to be there . Okay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hospital . But I \\'m sure the doctor you have is competent . It ai n\\'t that . You see , she \\'s just a kid herself , and she \\'s frightened . Her mother died that way . She read about you In the paper , Dr . Burgess . Well , of course , we never thought we could get ya . She was sayin\\'that It would be swell ... If she could get a guy like you to be with her . Did you tell her you were coming to see me ? No , sir . She and me ai n\\'t been gettin \\' along very well lately . I \\'ve been workin \\' nights . I did n\\'t tell her about it . She thinks I \\'ve been chiseling \\' on her , I guess . I ca n\\'t tell things like that . I \\'m kind of a mug that way . Of course , I could n\\'t pay you what you \\'re worth . But I tell ya . I make 45 bucks a week , and pick up 15 workin \\' nights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fight tonight . And I got 381 saved up , see ? - Are you a prizefighter ? - No , sir . But a friend of mine \\'s gettin \\' me on ... in the preliminaries over at the Empire Club . I get 10 bucks a round , and I do n\\'t mind takin \\' a beating for 40 bucks . Llsten , Dr . Burgess-I always been kinda proud , see ? You know , pay my own way , take nothin \\' from nobody . But I ai n\\'t that way now , Doc . I \\'m beggin \\' you . If she knew she was gon na have you with her ... everything would be all right . But as it is ... she \\'s so sick from worry-I \\'m afraid maybe she \\'ll die . Will you do it , Doc ? I \\'ll give you the $381 I got saved up ... and I \\'ll pay you back dollar for dollar . Please do it , will ya , Doc ? So help me , God , I\\'ll- I \\'ll lay down my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thanks . - I guess I \\'m kinda nervous about this child thing . - Mm-hmm . Kinda goofy , huh ? Gee , Doc , I \\'m sorry I have n\\'t got a cigar or somethin \\' to offer ya . I cut out smokin \\' . It was hurtin \\' my throat . This is a swell dump you got here . Oh , I did n\\'t mean-Okay . Flght ! - He said 9:00 . - Do n\\'t worry . You \\'d think the least he could do would be to be with me tonight . Now , now , now . Do n\\'t get yourself all worked up . One , two-Get out . Get out . Hey , Mike , knock that fella out , will ya ? This ai n\\'t a slaughterhouse . I wanted to give him a break , but I \\'ll put him away right at the next gong . Aw , why do n\\'t ya quit ? I know what I \\'m doin \\' . I would n\\'t take a beatin \\' like that for a hundred bucks . Yeah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . One , two , three , four ... five , six ... seven , eight , nine-Uh ! Do n\\'t knock me out , will ya , buddy ? I need the cash . - My wife \\'s gon na have a kid . - Well , why did n\\'t you tell me ? I guess I ca n\\'t make it though . Hold on to me . Take a deep breath . Break it up . Thanks . Good-bye . I \\'ve arranged for the hospital . The cab will be here at 11:00 . I never thought Eddie would do this to me . But , darling , he \\'s only an hour late . Some hours are lifetimes . He \\'s walked out on me . - When \\'s the kid expected ? - Any-Anytime now . - I got two of them . - Yeah ? How long before they get to know ya ? Mine knew me inside of two months . - But of course , mine was kinda extra bright . - Yeah . Oh , gee , kid , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad about you . - I could n\\'t help it . Could n\\'t spend a couple of minutes with me , tonight of all nights ? You know how nervous I am . But you could go to some speakeasy with a bunch of fellas ... and get your face all battered up in a drunken brawl . Is that what ya think ? That \\'s what it looks like to me . Okay . Do you want me to go with ya ? You do n\\'t have to bother about me anymore at all , Eddie . I got Burgess for ya ! - How about it , Doctor ? - Congratulations . Twins . - Twins ? - Twins . - Boys or girls ? - Both . - Twins ! - Yes , sir . The baby business is picking up . Sometimes I was here , and I was the only one . - This your first ? - Yes , and my last . I would n\\'t go through this again for all the money in the world . How many kids have you got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n\\'t know . You do n\\'t know ? I know I got six . What \\'s happening upstairs , I ca n\\'t tell ya . Here I am . You \\'re the father of a fine baby girl , Mr . Vernon . - Oh , well . - Oh ! - Put him over here on the-- It was too much for him . - He \\'ll be all right . - What \\'s the matter with him ? - I \\'ve got some smelling salts . - That \\'s fine . Give him some . - He \\'ll be all right . - He \\'s as white as a sheet . He \\'ll be all right in a minute . People kid about fathers , but they do n\\'t realize ... what a guy has to go through when his wife has a baby . If he had as many as I got , he \\'d stay unconscious . He \\'s coming to now . He \\'s fine . - What happened ? - You just had a baby . I would n\\'t go through this again for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or he \\'ll faint again . - It \\'s all right , Mr . Vernon . You come with me . - Hold him up . - Gee , I \\'m gettin \\' nervous myself now . Do n\\'t be nervous . Say , Mr . Linsky , I wan na ask you a question . My wife was n\\'t any too anxious to- to have this kid . Say , in two weeks , she will be crazy about it . - Is that straight ? - They always are . Be careful . Do n\\'t let her think that you are more concerned for the baby ... than what you are for her . Women get jealous under those conditions . You know , be interested , but not anxious . After all , you \\'ve known your wife for years ... and the baby is practically a stranger . Yeah , that \\'s right . Excuse me . I got ta phone my partner . Mr . Collins ? - Yeah ? - A boy . Okay . Your wife will see you in just a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know about that ? My kid \\'s 22 hours old already . They get old very quickly when they \\'re young . - Hello , Doctor . How are they ? - Fine . Say , Doc , I \\'ve got 350 bucks here . - And I \\'ll give ya-- Yeah , well , I have your bill here . Now , I have another patient . I must hurry . - Good luck to you , my lad . - Thanks . Gee , he \\'ll never let me speak to him about money . It says paid in full . And here \\'s a check . \\' \\' Pay to the order of Mr . Edward Collins \\'s son- $50 . \" What does that mean ? He \\'s giving your boy $50 to start a bank account . And he would n\\'t let me give him anything . Gee . That \\'s a guy for ya , ai n\\'t it ? Oh , they \\'re just grand , Mrs . Linsky . Every time I have a baby , my husband gives me a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n\\'t have any more room . - What do you think of it ? - Oh . Oh , no , this is n\\'t yours . This baby \\'s six days old . She acts like she hates the child . I guess maybe she did n\\'t want it . Do parents hate children they do n\\'t want ? I heard of people like that . How do you like this one ? - Oh , it \\'s darling . - Oh , no . This is young Mussolini . dd Gee , it \\'s funny when you think of it , ai n\\'t it ? Everybody in the world was once just a little bundle like that . - Is n\\'t this one cute ? - Oh , it \\'s lovely . Just look at those little hands . Did you ever see such an adorable nose ? Gee , it \\'s swell . Do n\\'t you want to hold your baby ? Is this mine ? - Honest ? Oh . - Thls Is It . I would n\\'t cry over It , Mrs . Colllns . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No ? Well , it \\'s the first time this baby was ever born . You can come in now . Hello , kid . - How do you feel ? - All right . Thanks for sending me the flowers . Okay . - Is that it ? - Yes , that \\'s it , and it \\'s no \\' \\' it . \" Well , I did n\\'t mean it that way . Let \\'s not talk about it . - That suits me too , kid . - I thought it would . We \\'ll take him back to the nursery now . I asked Dr . Burgess how we happened to get a fine doctor like him . He just laughed and said that you \\'d tell me . Oh , my boss knew him . He did it for him . - He give me a check for the baby \\'s bank too . - He did ? - Was n\\'t that swell of him ? - Yeah . Those big guys do a lot of work for charity . So you think of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I-Well - Gee , everything I say seems to be wrong . Oh , Eddie . I \\'d give anything if- well , if things were different . Aw , everything \\'s gon na be all right , kid . We ai n\\'t gon na stop living just because we got a baby . You and me is gon na have a good time , the same as always . Why , In six months we \\'ll have forgotten we got a kid . Please go now . I \\'m tired . Sure . - When \\'ll you be home ? - In about two weeks . Well , hurry it up . I \\'ll feel like stepping \\' out a bit . - So long , kid . - So long . I \\'ll be back every day . Oh , Mrs . Linsky , she \\'s getting bigger every day . What are you going to call her ? I \\'m calling her Shelly , after my mother-in-law . Her name was Esther , but it \\'s close enough . Well , how are all the mothers today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Is the cab downstairs ? - Yes . Are you ready ? Mm-hmm . - Are you leaving now ? - Yes . But I heard you tell your husband that you were going tomorrow . - I want to surprise him . - Oh . Say , listen , kid . - Have you thought this thing over ? - Yep . I could n\\'t live with a man that did n\\'t like his own child . All he thinks about is stepping out . I could n\\'t go back to Eddie for anything . I \\'d get to hate him . Well , it \\'s your funeral , kid . Well , what are you going to do with that ? Well , I thought maybe the kid would like to fool around with it . What ? A two-weeks-old baby ? Well , it \\'s only a little balloon . The doctor \\'s in the ward . You \\'ll have to wait a few minutes . - Dr . Gibson ? - Yes ? Just a minute , please . - Hurry , Nurse Parson . - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . My baby . Something \\'s happened to my baby ! Somethlng \\'s happening to my baby . No , Mrs . Collins . It \\'s all right . - I want my baby ! I want my baby ! - He \\'s all right . - I want my baby ! - Please listen . I want my baby ! I want my baby ! I want my baby ! - I want my baby ! - What \\'s the matter , kid ? - Something \\'s happened to my baby . - Where ? In there ! It \\'s not your baby . There \\'s no danger . Your husband will get it . Now , everything is all right . - It \\'s all right . - He \\'s all right , kid . Look . Here he is . - He \\'s all right . - It was Mrs . Burns \\'s baby .

    "This shows that likelihood of a word occurring is inversely proportional to its rank. This effect is called [Zipf's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zipf%27s_law), and suggests that the most frequent word will occur approximately twice as often as the second most frequent word, three times as often as the third most frequent word, etc. Zipf's law is most easily observed by plotting the data on a log-log graph, with the axes being log (rank order) and log (frequency) resulting in a linear relationship."

      "SEN. WHITEHOUSE SHARES WESTERLY GIRL'S STORY IN PUSH FOR STEM CELL RESEARCH\n",
      "  Sharing the story of Lila Barber, a 12 year old girl from Westerly, Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) on Tuesday, April 10, 2007, illustrated the hope stem cell research can offer in a speech on the Senate floor in favor of legislation to expand federal funding for stem cell research.  \n",
      "   Whitehouse met Lila two weeks ago. She was diagnosed two years ago with osteosarcoma, a cancerous bone condition, and last year underwent cadaver bone transplant surgery. The procedure saved her leg and is helping her remain cancer-free, but the transplanted tissue will not grow with her and likely will break down over time. Stem cell research, Whitehouse explained, could vastly improve the care of patients like Lila by allowing surgeons to enhance transplants with a patient's own stem cells, which could replace the lost bone and cartilage, or grow entirely new replacement bones and joints. \n",

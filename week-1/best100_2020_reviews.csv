0,Portrait of a Lady on Fire (Portrait de la jeune fille en feu),98,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/portrait_of_a_lady_on_fire/reviews?type=user,lifechanging a breath of fresh air that will also send chills down your spine with every conversation
1,Portrait of a Lady on Fire (Portrait de la jeune fille en feu),98,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/portrait_of_a_lady_on_fire/reviews?type=user,the portait of a lady on fire is about a painter who tries to paint a young lady who is about to get married without her knowing the cinematography deserves a prize the screen was literally a painting the colors were just amazing because the young lady doesnt know that the painter tries to paint her she thinks she is her friend and the painter tries to paint just by looking at her while they are together this really get you in the mood to try to visualize her characteristics as well the movie has no musicexcept some scenes and its pretty silent while the dialogues are slow and clear giving you the whole vibe of isolation i was feeling through out the first half of the movie that i am going to painter her as well and i found my self noticing little details about her the second half i didnt like it tho when the romance unravels between the painter and the lady i lost the whole excitement about the movie and become a boring romance in my opinion i found it completely unnecessary the scenes about the oldshool type abortions where really shocking i think the movie started well but didnt end well i recommend it tho i think that some people are going to find it a masterpiece definitely not me

8,Portrait of a Lady on Fire (Portrait de la jeune fille en feu),98,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/portrait_of_a_lady_on_fire/reviews?type=user,radical both in its handling of the artist and the subject and in its liberated sense of femininity aware as it is of patriarchal forces at the margins its orchestration of gazes and glances starts out beguiling until it becomes breathtaking the film made me lean forward in my seat awash in the beauty of its images in thrall to the growing passions of its characters a witchy scene by a campfire in particular brings the film to a level of rapture

set piece galore but i loved every minute of it"
1,1917,89,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1917_2019/reviews?type=user,amazing camera work and a very intense and interesting story
2,1917,89,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1917_2019/reviews?type=user,equipped with fantastic performances incredible cinematography and a gritty and realistic depiction of world war i 1917 is one of the best films centered around war in years sam mendes directing is truly inspirational as he manages to bring light to even the bleakest and most rugged of stories
3,1917,89,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1917_2019/reviews?type=user,very disappointed  a waste of my time  dont see why this movie got such good reviews and won as best motion picture for drama  the chrachter and movie evoked no emotion on the part of this viewer  there was no charachter development  i had no feelings for the charachters neither liked them nor disliked them   boring basically two guys trying to get from point a to point b in the middle of a ground war
4,1917,89,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1917_2019/reviews?type=user,an absolute mustsee my favourite war movie of all time and in my top ten films of all time
5,1917,89,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1917_2019/reviews?type=user,my biggest gripe with war movies is that theyre either too long andor too boring this was neither of those wonderfully shot and mostly in real time it really does command your attention the whole way thru as two young british soldiers traverse through the battlefield trying to get a message to another battalion to warn them of a trap just a magnificent film all around and the brief big star cameos of a few corporals was also great
6,1917,89,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1917_2019/reviews?type=user,1917 ticks all of the cinematic boxes a riveting story oscarwinning photography and a stunning conclusion that barely allows you to look away
7,1917,89,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1917_2019/reviews?type=user,enjoyable movie to watch the only unrealistic thing in the movie was the dead bodies in real life i believe the main characters would have taken a wider path around them due to the stench also if the germans had recently withdrawn the bodies wouldnt have been so decayed or do you think prior to withdrawing the german soldiers left stinking dead bodies in the area where they were living and defending hollywood for ya wanting to add some grossness to their film
8,1917,89,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1917_2019/reviews?type=user,very little for a film so valued and winner of an oscar it is empty a unmotivating story and incongruous scenes 119 minutes of murky scenes that did not lead anywhere the most notable is the recreation of world war i
9,1917,89,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1917_2019/reviews?type=user,a war genre masterpiece resembles a lot christopher nolans dunkirk where the viewer is kept tense and focused on the minute by minute
0,The Invisible Man,91,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_invisible_man_2020/reviews?type=user,one of the best horrorthrillers in recent years
1,The Invisible Man,91,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_invisible_man_2020/reviews?type=user,a reimagined masterpiece this thriller knows what buttons to push tying together themes of abusive relationships and science as a tool for terror its a movie that takes its time but where it actually works best is the long breathing moments
2,The Invisible Man,91,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_invisible_man_2020/reviews?type=user,i could see the man
3,The Invisible Man,91,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_invisible_man_2020/reviews?type=user,the remake of the classic 1933 invisible man adds a modernday update to the tale that keeps both the terrifying fun of the original while also standing out as its own thing though not at all as groundbreaking as the original in terms of special effects id be lying if i said this wasnt a worthy film to be recognized as the definitive invisible man
4,The Invisible Man,91,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_invisible_man_2020/reviews?type=user,exceptionally good elisabeth moss holds together a surprisingly depthfilled horror about domestic abuse and obsession a feeling of dread and fear triumph in what is essentially elisabeth mosss first leading film role not what you would expect from an invisible man film and all the better for it
5,The Invisible Man,91,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_invisible_man_2020/reviews?type=user,weary of the special effects and the superhuman ninja aspect but liked a few of the twists not elizabeths best work
6,The Invisible Man,91,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_invisible_man_2020/reviews?type=user,she got a raw deal with that husband lol good acting
7,The Invisible Man,91,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_invisible_man_2020/reviews?type=user,"why me adrian you could have had any woman you wanted is the question the chief protagonist played by elisabeth moss asks the antagonist it is a question i was asking myself through this elisabeth moss is an unlikely choice to play the role of wifepartner of a handsome young tech entrepreneur
additionally i struggled to empathize or sympathize with her character in the hands of many other actresses this script would have been given its just dues overall a disappointing outcome for an overhyped movie"
8,The Invisible Man,91,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_invisible_man_2020/reviews?type=user,this scifithriller set on abuse against women film gets viewer tension to its max point when the viewer watches how invisible man makes looks cecilia like a crazy woman
9,The Invisible Man,91,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_invisible_man_2020/reviews?type=user,"invisible man 2020 

great piece of modern horror 
havent seen the original 1933 film but can tell that this isnt gonna be your typical scary movie but a 
true suspense  thriller masterwork combining scifi  horror leigh warnell definitely seems to know the path he took since doing upgrade2018 
low budget  highly creative 

excellent acting 
specially from elizabeth moss"

2,One Night in Miami,98,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/one_night_in_miami/reviews?type=user,incredibly boring after the first half an hour

6,One Night in Miami,98,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/one_night_in_miami/reviews?type=user,great movie  for a directorial debut regina king rose to the challenge and then soared above  this movie was interesting from beginning to end  how she managed to intertwine all the characters stories and still no one outshines the other  brilliant  cant wait for her next movie  if shes this good just starting i think she will be onstage at the oscars receiving best director in no time i absolutely loved the movie
7,One Night in Miami,98,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/one_night_in_miami/reviews?type=user,well acted story line a little bit scattered good directorial debut by regina king

0,Ma Rainey's Black Bottom,98,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/ma_raineys_black_bottom/reviews?type=user,i wanted to to like it but i would not recommend this movie to any one i know
1,Ma Rainey's Black Bottom,98,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/ma_raineys_black_bottom/reviews?type=user,brilliant characterdriven theatre
2,Ma Rainey's Black Bottom,98,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/ma_raineys_black_bottom/reviews?type=user,honestly teetering on giving it an extra half star for the third act kind of reminded me of 12 angry men with how the dialogue carried the movie my goodness did we lose a serious talent in boseman seriously incredible acting here and a monologue for the books edit i did it i gave it 35 lol
3,Ma Rainey's Black Bottom,98,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/ma_raineys_black_bottom/reviews?type=user,sensational another incredible transition of august wilson literature into film chadwick boseman and viola davis breathe excellence into this body of work one of the most profound though gutwrenching films of 2020 i foresee a posthumous academy award on the horizon for chadwick boseman
4,Ma Rainey's Black Bottom,98,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/ma_raineys_black_bottom/reviews?type=user,really not about ma raney  its about her band which was not what i signed up for  the title is the best thing about it
5,Ma Rainey's Black Bottom,98,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/ma_raineys_black_bottom/reviews?type=user,clearly well produced shot and acted i have no connection to ma rainey and truth be told was unaware of who she was prior to watching the movie upon learning this was based on a stage play i think this is a case of a poor adaptation of medium with its sweeping monologues quickly rising and falling demeanors and minimal sets this seems perfectly well suited for a play but artificially small for a film bosemans over the top bravado sure is something to behold but also gives the film a near surreal placingagainin the spirit of a stage play
6,Ma Rainey's Black Bottom,98,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/ma_raineys_black_bottom/reviews?type=user,i ended up liking this by the end at first it felt too much like a play and then i found out it was an adaptation of a play translating a story from stage to screen always creates a strange choreography of sorts the language made me uncomfortable honestly but i powered through it the acting was great here viola did a superior job as usual by the time the story ended i was sold good story
7,Ma Rainey's Black Bottom,98,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/ma_raineys_black_bottom/reviews?type=user,good acting couldnt save this bland and lengthy story chad bozeman will be missed 
8,Ma Rainey's Black Bottom,98,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/ma_raineys_black_bottom/reviews?type=user,uma atuação digna de oscar em seu ultimo trabalho chadwick boseman mostra todo seu talento e nos deixa com gostinho de quero mais filme com ótimo enredo e atuação impecável de viola davis
9,Ma Rainey's Black Bottom,98,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/ma_raineys_black_bottom/reviews?type=user,ma raineys black bottom is an enduring and relevant drama uplifted by viola davis and chadwick bosemans award worthy performances
0,Never Rarely Sometimes Always,99,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/never_rarely_sometimes_always/reviews?type=user,profound meaningful fantastic and important a tale of beautiful and believable friendship that shows its strength through the most challenging times never rarely sometimes always shows the light at the end of the tunnel by letting us pass the darkest tunnel is it perfect no is it essential damn straight
1,Never Rarely Sometimes Always,99,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/never_rarely_sometimes_always/reviews?type=user,what a powerful film this one is tough pulls no punches and is realistic to a daring level 2020 has another good film with the plot as never rarely sometimes always in unpregnant but where this separates itself is in the strippeddown nature of story following autumn you feel the claustrophobia of her situation and as we progress with her the fear of the situation becomes all encompassing hittmans choice to keep the camera on autumn and her performance in one scene results in arguably the best scenes of the year i wouldve preferred added dialogue to  develop certain relationships further otherwise this is a fantastic outing from hitman and her cast
2,Never Rarely Sometimes Always,99,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/never_rarely_sometimes_always/reviews?type=user,this was incredible it gave an unflinching look into a touchy subject matter and held nothing back the scene where the protagonist is asked a string of uncomfortable questions and the camera never leaves her face is phenomenal eliza hittman hits it out of the park as a writerdirector while sidney flanigan and talia ryder deliver excellent performances
3,Never Rarely Sometimes Always,99,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/never_rarely_sometimes_always/reviews?type=user,an interesting look into a girls journey to terminate an unwanted pregnancy intense 
4,Never Rarely Sometimes Always,99,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/never_rarely_sometimes_always/reviews?type=user,a very real and riveting story of what many teenage girls face in america on the surface it seems a quiet film however it is really packed with many emotionally charged provocative situations well done directing writing and acting i wont forget this film
5,Never Rarely Sometimes Always,99,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/never_rarely_sometimes_always/reviews?type=user,i didnt connect with the main characters as much as i hoped and the story is pretty slowpaced but never rarely sometimes always is a wellacted and moving drama dealing with themes on prochoice and the difficulties young women face in regular life with a strong performance by sidney flanigan and is welldirected by eliza hittman
6,Never Rarely Sometimes Always,99,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/never_rarely_sometimes_always/reviews?type=user,a soberly penetrating and disquiet examination on the atrocities of adolescent pregnancy and the bureaucracy of teenage abortion that is most shocking in the scene when the protagonist divulges troubling occurrences as takes the titular likertscale questionnaire
7,Never Rarely Sometimes Always,99,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/never_rarely_sometimes_always/reviews?type=user,best pictureworthy quite possibly the most realistic film ive ever seen especially impressive with the restraints of a pg13 rating what helps is how nothing feels overdramatized to the point of being melodramatic this will cause some people to probably call this boring and say that nothing happened and the depressing part is isnt that kind of most of our lives the daytoday mundane our lives usually arent summarized by two exciting hours of footage of everybody screaming at each other for an oscar 8510
8,Never Rarely Sometimes Always,99,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/never_rarely_sometimes_always/reviews?type=user,should finish in my bottom 5 of the year
9,Never Rarely Sometimes Always,99,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/never_rarely_sometimes_always/reviews?type=user,nrsa takes viewers on a time taking emotionally gripping character journey as two girls find their lost selves in nyc to make us more aware of the enduring procedure to be witnessed 475
0,Soul,95,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/soul_2020/reviews?type=user,a beautifully crafted touching well acted voice and animated film which actually has a very deep soul
1,Soul,95,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/soul_2020/reviews?type=user,a good and entraining movie
2,Soul,95,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/soul_2020/reviews?type=user,didnt really work on me maybe i have no soul
3,Soul,95,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/soul_2020/reviews?type=user,pixar has done it again this time more mature and capable to reach the adults and has some funny moments for their children it balances life and death very well with characters you care about as for the animation style they took was a bit strange and i ended up liking it the soundtrack was cool and jazzy terry time was a stand out for me though the way they executed the before world i thought was a little lazy but other wise even with its weaknesses this was still likable so go check it out on disney 
4,Soul,95,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/soul_2020/reviews?type=user,pixars best movie since inside out or finding dory its visually and soundly extraordinary but it didnt move me neither me nor nobody in my house i really think the ending was terrible and i also hated terry the villain but the rest is fantastic the greatbefore is the most inventive pixar universe ever the soundtrack is  the best of the year and joe and 22 have the charisma that ian and barley from onward dont have pixar is still breathing and theyre still not ready to go to the great beyond
5,Soul,95,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/soul_2020/reviews?type=user,a multilayered funny moving believable and intelligent film that can easily be revisited two or three times the animation is a subtle technological feat with some great old school elements the story and characters are so  engrossing that this would have been a good film even if it had been a live action production
6,Soul,95,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/soul_2020/reviews?type=user,"i think is a movie for grown up people live inside and out 
i love it i love the meaning that disney give to life and death"
7,Soul,95,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/soul_2020/reviews?type=user,fascinating premise and props to pixar for the first black leading role the animation was superb as usual but there was a lack of connection every pixar movie makes me emotional but this one didnt push that button i think it was the characters 54
8,Soul,95,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/soul_2020/reviews?type=user,this film does not seem to really fit the description of a childrens move  this feels more like a love letter from pixar to the generation that started out with them reminding us that we may not be children anymore but we still have soul
9,Soul,95,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/soul_2020/reviews?type=user,que filme magnifico a mensagem que o filme repassa é muito importante mais um tocante filme da pixar com uma qualidade extraordinária recomendo
0,Hamilton,98,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/hamilton_2020/reviews?type=user,what a waste of time a ridiculously goofy remake what a sign of the times yes lets add hip hop into the mix dare i say i saw a character with a ski cap hamilton hits the ghetto i cant tell if this is pc or p i but all i have to say is p u
1,Hamilton,98,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/hamilton_2020/reviews?type=user,garbage  complete garbage
2,Hamilton,98,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/hamilton_2020/reviews?type=user,tan solo espectacular
3,Hamilton,98,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/hamilton_2020/reviews?type=user,first of all i would like to remember everyone that this is not a film it is a piece of musical theater that was filmed so that other people outside the usa could see it and i must say that it was an amazing thing to have been done because its an amazing piece of music i am personally not a person fond of musicals but hamilton is a great exception i really loved watching this piece although it missed a bit of alexander hamiltons life namely his relationship with slavery in the usa nevertheless it was an amazing musical linmanuel miranda and the rest of the team did an amazing job and we were able to see great talent in these actors but special attention to linmanuel miranda for making this musical possible
4,Hamilton,98,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/hamilton_2020/reviews?type=user,"i can sum hamilton up in the following sentence

linmanuel miranda is a genius"
5,Hamilton,98,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/hamilton_2020/reviews?type=user,"very well staged good costumes christopher jackson delivered gravitas as george washington while jonathan groff was interesting as george the 3rd i liked lin manuel miranda as alexander hamilton and phillipa soo as his wife 
but the whole show was interesting but not memorable i cant remember any of the songs unlike other stage performances such as fiddler on the roof or rogers and hammerstein musicals historically inaccuracies occur but thats know to happen with any type of production that is based on historical people or events
maybe seeing it live might be better"
6,Hamilton,98,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/hamilton_2020/reviews?type=user,this musical is revolutionary
7,Hamilton,98,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/hamilton_2020/reviews?type=user,fantastic acting storytelling dancing music and production they made a dryboring topic into a magnificent play must watch
8,Hamilton,98,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/hamilton_2020/reviews?type=user,"this felt so wrong i actually stopped watching it more to do with the idea of how to bring the story across the singing  actors seemed fine 
this was disturbing and felt like it was trying to make slavery entertaining and having to put these two words together is utter shocking  makes me hope its a parody on the film industry  audiences like the producers not actually franz liebkind spring time for hitler coming to life set in auschwitz 

i actually feel sick but it was the only way i could explain it"
9,Hamilton,98,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/hamilton_2020/reviews?type=user,great cast performing great songs   this gets my vote for best movie of the year
0,Sound of Metal,97,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/sound_of_metal/reviews?type=user,this movie still comes to mind weeks after watching it quiet but thought provoking
1,Sound of Metal,97,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/sound_of_metal/reviews?type=user,an indepth look at the deaf community sound of metal is a powerful yet beautiful drama bought to life by riz ahmeds riveting performance 
2,Sound of Metal,97,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/sound_of_metal/reviews?type=user,incredible performance from riz ahmed
3,Sound of Metal,97,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/sound_of_metal/reviews?type=user,powerfully acted and sincere i really felt the pain fear and worry of these characters as they navigate the traumatic events unfolding rapidly before them there could be some serious awards coming this films way in the near future a bit slow at times but still a wonderful story to experience 810
4,Sound of Metal,97,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/sound_of_metal/reviews?type=user,masterful riz ahmed is at the top of his game in this emotional ride of a film
5,Sound of Metal,97,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/sound_of_metal/reviews?type=user,amazing film loved it
6,Sound of Metal,97,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/sound_of_metal/reviews?type=user,the feeling of absolute silence those moments of stillness they will never abandon you the whole movie is about coming to terms with your reality which is what life is all about this according to me is a message as important as life itself
7,Sound of Metal,97,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/sound_of_metal/reviews?type=user,"throughout most of the movie we are experiencing it through riz ahmeds point of viewhearing this way we share in his journey and it offers an interesting insight into the lives of deaf people and how they experience their world
sound editing in this movie was phenomenal soothing everyday sounds like the rustling of the leaves and grass the drops in the coffee pot in the morning and the voices of your loved ones become that more powerful and precious when we switch to a third persons perspective as riz loses his hearing they managed to make even the sound of silence have a shape and form so we could experience it as well
riz ahmeds acting was the highlight of this film and in my opinion makes him a strong contender for this years oscars nominations every single step of his journey through the stages of grief for his loss we were there with him feeling every moment from shock and pain to anger and acceptance olivia cooke was also amazing showcasing wonderfully how our pain affects our loved ones who try their hardest to help us both managed to make me invested in their story in just a few minutes
even though this was not a true story it felt like one it felt like it could be anyones story about the loss of something or someone precious and an exploration of their grieving process thats an amazing feat for darius marders directorial debut the oscars buzz around this movie is well deserved"
8,Sound of Metal,97,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/sound_of_metal/reviews?type=user,so i really was not sure what to expect with the sound of metal  ruben and lous music is not for me but other than that this was a real emotional roller coaster  well acted and  excellent writing of such a believable story
9,Sound of Metal,97,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/sound_of_metal/reviews?type=user,great sound design and great acting of riz ahmed didnt like the point of the movie tho i think the message passed by this film is not so correct
0,Da 5 Bloods,92,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/da_5_bloods/reviews?type=user,stupid just another stupid hollywood flcik so unreal
1,Da 5 Bloods,92,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/da_5_bloods/reviews?type=user,a near perfect movie though the amount of deaths that occurred didnt exactly need to happen
2,Da 5 Bloods,92,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/da_5_bloods/reviews?type=user,this movie suffers from a serious lack of editing its shapeless and overly long and the first and second halves dont really connect
3,Da 5 Bloods,92,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/da_5_bloods/reviews?type=user,this movie is much too long and unfocused if the filmmakers had cut about an hours worth of footage it would be infinitely better as it is its an ordeal to sit through this meandering slow movie with little reward
4,Da 5 Bloods,92,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/da_5_bloods/reviews?type=user,spike lee is still doing movies as he always been angry dramautic sometimes messy and funny
5,Da 5 Bloods,92,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/da_5_bloods/reviews?type=user,like most spike lee movies theres a potentially good film hidden in the midst of all the crud that he should have cut out this movie is about eighty minutes too long for its material
6,Da 5 Bloods,92,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/da_5_bloods/reviews?type=user,spike lee hasnt produced a good movie in decades this is badly written slow and pretentious
7,Da 5 Bloods,92,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/da_5_bloods/reviews?type=user,spike lee ran out of ideas long ago this is very disappointing
8,Da 5 Bloods,92,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/da_5_bloods/reviews?type=user,da 5 bloods has a lot of great scenes in it but it also has some flawed scenes as well i feel like if those flaws were polished a bit this couldve been a great movie but it still stands as a very wellmade thoughtprovoking powerful and ambitious spike lee joint with some great performances by its leads a standout and oscar worthy performance by delroy lindo who gives one of the best performances of the year and lees usual brand of harsh political commentary
9,Da 5 Bloods,92,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/da_5_bloods/reviews?type=user,i love the big moment when the mood of the movie changes its completely unexpected but after that things get too rambo and it feels too much action

1,Miss Juneteenth,100,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/miss_juneteenth/reviews?type=user,miss juneteenth is a powerful film that follows the life of a former miss juneteenth in fort worth and how all her hopes and dreams rest with her 14 year old daughter becoming the next miss juneteenth filmed primarily in east fort worth and in the womans club youll recognize the downtown skyline bakers funeral home and maybe the lucky mini mart written and directed by channing godfrey peoples the daughter of local racial justice activist and tarrant county democratic party leader deborah peoples it includes music by local composer and my next door neighbor curtis heath  nicole beharie plays turquoise jones who struggles financially and is raising her daughter kai as a single mom her husband has done time in jail and is generally not reliable as a dad or husband turq works in local black owned waymans bbqbeer joint and must pull extra shifts to pay for kais dress for the miss juneteenth pageant she wants to give kai a leg up in life but cant ever seem to get ahead financially wayman played by marcus m mauldin gives a powerful speech about owning his own business and not having to go to the white man for help just so proud to have this important film made right here in the city i live buy it now on amazon prime or itunes and support locally made films made by starring and about black lives i give it 5 out of 5 stars el duderino macfarlane 
2,Miss Juneteenth,100,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/miss_juneteenth/reviews?type=user,quaint and touching but the plot is so standard there is not much too this
3,Miss Juneteenth,100,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/miss_juneteenth/reviews?type=user,miss juneteenth is very sweet in the motherdaughter relationship at its core they are the films heart and all of those scenes were wonderful the ending is also daring and different the problem here is that all the other characters werent well realized and the sections starring them certainly did grind the film to a halt
4,Miss Juneteenth,100,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/miss_juneteenth/reviews?type=user,"socially insightful and still a lightonitsfeet drama miss juneteenth delivers more layered conflicts than another recent and still likable film about a pageant mom at odds with her daughter dumplin nicole beharie stars as turquoise a young steadfast single mother trying to empower her teenage daughter while navigating her own derailed destiny

its not particularly creatively shot but it is engaging from start to finish and debut writerdirector channing godfrey peoples gently weaves sobering racial history into the smalltown texas setting and turquoises own journey beharie refreshingly avoids flashiness and melodramatic peaks and her performance is all the more resonant for it you will not only feel but truly understand her pride her regret her resolve her hope her diplomacy all the plates she is constantly restacking as she tries to position her daughter for success in life

peoples has crafted a prudent film if not a tremendous one"
5,Miss Juneteenth,100,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/miss_juneteenth/reviews?type=user,this little slice of life movie is just wonderful  the struggles and past and the present of this mother determined to make her teenage daughter become this year miss junetennth as she was was is the focus of the movie other issues are employement men poverty and family  this is a must see  how does this movie have a viewer rating of 59
6,Miss Juneteenth,100,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/miss_juneteenth/reviews?type=user,genuinely sweet family drama that shows the resiliency of the bond between mother and daughter
7,Miss Juneteenth,100,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/miss_juneteenth/reviews?type=user,miss juneteenth is vivid and beautiful and a wonderful introduction to the importance of june 19th to people of color in texas however its also uneven and heavy handed and disappointing  the sub plots are tangential and unfocused and even the main through line a college scholarship pageant is either under explored or over explored  despite the predictability and the flaws its worth watching for the performance of alexis chikaeze in her first performance  she plays the teenage daughter and does it well  it feels lived in and authentic to a point  final score  6510
8,Miss Juneteenth,100,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/miss_juneteenth/reviews?type=user,the story is very formulaic and the characters are too slight its ok to pass the time
9,Miss Juneteenth,100,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/miss_juneteenth/reviews?type=user,miss juneteenth is a quietly great film its small in story but large in strength and honesty its centred around superlative performances from the lead actors giving a strong portrayal of surviving and coping with the travails of life juneteenth is a celebration of the day june 19 1865 when slaves were declared free in texas each year in fort worth there is a beauty pageant on said holiday and the central character of this film turquoise jones was crowned miss juneteenth when she was 15 however instead of launching a successful career she had a child soon after putting her dreams on hold now her daughter kai is entering the pageant although for her its not such a big deal the pageant frames this story but it is more about the mother daughter relationship that fills the film turquoise works long hours in a bbq joint to make ends meet and each day is just about getting to the next kai is super smart and looks herself to find a way to fulfill her own dreams its a simple story but one told very well it manages to make its points about sexism and racism without shouting it nicole beharie and alexis chikaeze are extremely good in their lead roles and for a debut film director channing godfrey peoples has crafted a film that is very easy to like and admire
0,Wolfwalkers,99,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/wolfwalkers/reviews?type=user,completely magical in every detail the development of the characters the story that at first glance is usually simple delves into topics such as friendship family among others and the 2d animation is far from dead
1,Wolfwalkers,99,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/wolfwalkers/reviews?type=user,i really loved the artwork and whimsy of the forests and the stark contrast to the bleakness of the town its visual appeal was out of this world one critique i have is how they made the villain an open christian which as a christian myself made me feel pretty targeted and unsettled not saying all christians are saints but i feel the remarks about doing gods will while obviously being evil could have been left out overall i definitely would recommend it as it appealed to all ages and really highlighted the beautiful celtic artwork
2,Wolfwalkers,99,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/wolfwalkers/reviews?type=user,not even the likes of lord of the rings or interstellar can compete with this if interstellar is a 910 and i bloody loved that movie this ones an obvious 1010  masterpiece
3,Wolfwalkers,99,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/wolfwalkers/reviews?type=user,absolutely stunning traditional animation beautiful retelling of celtic mythology lovable child protagonists and an absolute punch to the gut so of course i completely love it
4,Wolfwalkers,99,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/wolfwalkers/reviews?type=user,really nice movie about humans wolves belonging and protecting nature its mostly handdrawn and hand painted which makes it even more impressive and it wasnt from pixar
5,Wolfwalkers,99,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/wolfwalkers/reviews?type=user,animations remind me of old childhood movie from the soviet era its ok i guess but i really dont see why every one is so over the moon about this animation really
6,Wolfwalkers,99,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/wolfwalkers/reviews?type=user,preciosa una animación clásica con colores deslumbrantes y buenos personajes la historia es buena sin ser nada nuevo pero lo que le da vida son sus personajes en especial mebh óg mactíre y moll mactíre cuyo diseño es encantador
7,Wolfwalkers,99,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/wolfwalkers/reviews?type=user,"given that this film had a 99 overall rating i thought i have to give it a watch

how disappointed was i to find that it was a movie with nothing but a ham fisted version of current day identity politics as its entire inspiration  
beautifully drawn and animated which are the only reasons it get 15 stars but the subtext of the film is so thinly veiled it may as well be a plexiglass look into the mind of a person who only sees life through the lens of identity politics this kind of animation is dangerous for children


edit how does this movie still show a 100 audience rating when both mine and others have given it less that 2 stars and there are only 47 submissions

i remember in the past rotten tomatoes being accused of score fiddling  looks like they are at it again"
8,Wolfwalkers,99,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/wolfwalkers/reviews?type=user,wolfwalkers is the most beautiful film of 2020 moores unmistakable style is surprising  intricate in ways most animation doesnt even try thankfully its more than a pretty face its a unique vision of narrowminded bigotry  the dangers of religiouslyjustified imperialism the brave grace with which it handles the lack of systemic shifts instead focusing on the individual changes is moving  honest in a year with 2 pixar films this is the best family film of 2020
9,Wolfwalkers,99,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/wolfwalkers/reviews?type=user,fantastic movie the art work was beautiful and the storyline was both touching and enthralling its one of those movies id watch multiple times lovely

1,His House,100,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/his_house/reviews?type=user,this movie was quite intellectually demanding really got you thinking about the underlying themes with of course the great spook element 
2,His House,100,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/his_house/reviews?type=user,fucking phenomenal in every regard rial and bol grab you and never let go
3,His House,100,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/his_house/reviews?type=user,eerie atmosphere psychologically disturbing the movie focuses on how a past crime could shatter a mans conscience quite a fantastic performance i must say
4,His House,100,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/his_house/reviews?type=user,dumb film the chicken at the start was the scariest thing about it dont bother with it 90 minutes of boredom
5,His House,100,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/his_house/reviews?type=user,"if youre looking for scares his house is low on them there are horror elements but this is less of a horror film more drama 
there are some good moments with the backstory the most interesting thread but if you go in with highexpectations you will be disappointed"
6,His House,100,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/his_house/reviews?type=user,this is a great mix of real life issues  scary movie its also a great example of cultural clashes  how people work through them
7,His House,100,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/his_house/reviews?type=user,the meaning was ok and obvious but the film is just utterly rubbish
8,His House,100,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/his_house/reviews?type=user,this film is awful do not waste your time watching it
9,His House,100,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/his_house/reviews?type=user,i think that this movie is incredibly well done what a different take on horror film one that is definitely a terrifying idea to have to ever face but they do a different take on how terrifying it must be to come overseas from a country with so much violence and the possibility of losing your life just to get to a place you truly call home 55  not the idea of horror we see every year at halloween

0,Crip Camp: A Disability Revolution,100,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/crip_camp_a_disability_revolution/reviews?type=user,moving and inspiring to say the least
1,Crip Camp: A Disability Revolution,100,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/crip_camp_a_disability_revolution/reviews?type=user,beginning in the early 1950s camp jened in upstate new york was a place where teenagers with disabilities could go and experience many for the first time a place where they could be teenagers and live freely with people like them with disabilities in the late 60s and early 70s the camp was run by hippies so there were a lot of freedoms provided that the kids did not get elsewhere many of these summer campers ended up migrating to the center for independent living in berkeley an innovative center focused on providing services to the disabled it was here that the movement for passage of the rehabilitation act particularly section 504 and the americans with disabilities act began  this is a wonderful film that details the path toward the passage of section 504 and the ada act fortunately for us a local theater troupe spent significant time filming the kids there is a lot of archival footage that is just such a joy to watch  they are being kids they are funny and they all talk about being in a place that values them for who they are the way many of these kids later as adults and with the support of many organizations mobilized to create change is inspiring several of those kids are still alive today and the film contains a lot of interview footage as these older adults look back on their times in the movement and in camp jened huge thumbs up from me i absolutely loved this film that is an important and poignant slice of history it is a film everyone should see it is amazing to me that with all of the footage and the people who are still alive today that this movie was only made this year i learned an incredible amount of history and about the profound impact these people have had on disability rights
2,Crip Camp: A Disability Revolution,100,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/crip_camp_a_disability_revolution/reviews?type=user,it was actually pretty damn good there was some kind of problems with it but i wont name here but it was an amazing movie and i would love to give another rewatch and do this is going to be a watch every year kind of movie

4,The Trial of the Chicago 7,90,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_trial_of_the_chicago_7/reviews?type=user,"i cannot comment on how historically accurate this film was but it wasnt a documentary so it didnt have to be explicitly accurate anyway i found it to be a perfunctory recreation of the trial procedures of this famous case the judge hoffman was indeed an ass an a disgrace to the idea of courtroom justice 
baron cohen redmayne abdumateen rylance and langella were all fine as was gordonlevitt can we stop with all the hyphenated names already  but i was not particularly taken by the movie it was not absorbing or especially interesting the way sorkin went about his work the tone was not one with any real sense of urgency intensity or other such qualities that i wouldve expected from the significance of the trial itself or the defendants 
3 stars"
5,The Trial of the Chicago 7,90,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_trial_of_the_chicago_7/reviews?type=user,an absolute mustsee it keeps you glued to the screen both with the story and the cinematography and it makes you truly feel the injustice that these people experienced

7,The Trial of the Chicago 7,90,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_trial_of_the_chicago_7/reviews?type=user,my only issue with the film is that i thought the should have lingered on bobby seales story a moment longer besides that i think it is an incredibly important movie to watch especially in todays political climate to note the eerie similarities today to a time we should have left far in the past the acting is spotless and passionate a mustwatch
8,The Trial of the Chicago 7,90,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_trial_of_the_chicago_7/reviews?type=user,aaron sorkin tries to rewrite history and whitewash the chicago 7s true ideals

3,Onward,88,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/onward/reviews?type=user,la animación es muy brillante y trabajada sin dejar del lado el concepto de unir lo fantástico y medieval con lo actual con una trama muy entretenida que le hace honor al género de aventura
4,Onward,88,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/onward/reviews?type=user,while it may follow the pixar playbook stepbystep onward is still an entertaining childrens film about two brothers who try to summon magic to bring back their deceased father for one more day in this heartwarming adventure

7,Onward,88,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/onward/reviews?type=user,"onward

the one hour and forty two minute film by disney pixarrated pg is about two brothers who lost their father at a young age discovering that their father left them just enough magic to see him for one last day once they were old enough the son who knows magic betterwhich at this point was the thing of fairy tales because its lack of use was sadly not the one with the gift the other son had the luck he only got half of his father to appear before the staff he was using broke the movie follows their journey in order to find another crystal for the staff they struggle through many obstacles that only make their bond stronger the movie follows an amazing screenplay its chaotic in the best way the movie goes by so fast the reality of this ever occurring is nonexistent so its a good movie for younger audiences this would never happen in real life and the fact that its animated further proves that there are a lot of wide shots to empathize the drama i noticed a few times when the camera had fallen to the ground in a fight that they were in there was amazing use of realistic instances there were parts where i forgot it was animated even though the characters were blue overall the camera angles perfectly fit the movie and i would give them a 1010 all the transitions were perfect and there were no bad jump cuts the whole movie was edited and there were sometimes where it jumped without a context so i would give that an 810"

0,Dick Johnson Is Dead,100,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/dick_johnson_is_dead/reviews?type=user,when delivered with the news of her fathers failing health due to alzheimers and having already lost her mother to the disease director kirsten johnson comes up with a great way of preparing her dad for the end of his life she decides to closely monitor and film him but also adds a touch of humour to the proceedings but inventing lots of different ways for him to die and filming the results on the surface this may sound a tad morbid but its far from it its a beautiful and touching celebration of a man who clearly means so much to so many and dick johnson himself is such an affable and purehearted presence that its a joy to see him having fun and being part of the whole experience a lovely documentary that im sure many people wished they could achieve in both remembering and saying goodbye to a loved one
1,Dick Johnson Is Dead,100,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/dick_johnson_is_dead/reviews?type=user,such a unique and incredible documentary about life and death won a special jury award at sundance worth the watch streaming on netflix
2,Dick Johnson Is Dead,100,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/dick_johnson_is_dead/reviews?type=user,if you are alive absolute must see
3,Dick Johnson Is Dead,100,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/dick_johnson_is_dead/reviews?type=user,"dick johnson is dead is a documentary but its a hard movie to describe because at its core its the use of art to memorialize a man to process grief on personal terms and as a love letter from a daughter to a father kirsten johnston cameraperson records her life caring for her ailing 85yearold father dick is a former therapist a widower and starting to go through the early stages of alzheimers and coming to terms with his new limitations kirsten is a camera operator who has worked on documentaries for over thirty years so she turns the lens on her father and the two of them enact a series of wacky fake deaths starring dick himself until the stuntmen take over as father and daughter work to make a movie celebrating life while they still can together

first things first dick johnson is just the sweetest man spending time with him is a treat and watching him smile with like his whole face just made me feel happy i enjoyed learning just what a good person he was and what hes meant to his friends family and colleagues but hes just so pleasant and nice and compassionate that you feel the love his daughter intends you to understand thats the overwhelming feeling from this quirky documentary dick has such love for his daughter and is willing to humor her silly morbid scenarios confronting his death kirsten has loved this man for so long and already lost one parent to alzheimers and now must go through it again shes using the medium she feels most capable and comfortable with photography and moviemaking to celebrate her father and his unheralded life of being a good man coming to an end my heart ached for him when he breaks into tears articulating what relinquishing his ability to drive means for him and his sense of independence looking ahead kirsten highlights some of the more unusual details about her father for this moviewithinamovie creating sequences that shed light on his faith as a seventh day adventist and his insecurity over how his feet appear its insightful aspects that better round out this man like his ability to start conversations with strangers or his knack of being able to fall asleep anywhere as long as he can prop his feet up for kirsten recording these moments while her father is still lucid is a matter of documenting him while he can still recognize himself she laments the minuscule amount of footage she has of her mother before her death she doesnt want to make the same mistake with her father so why not also make him a movie star if she can watching dick johnson is dead is to feel overcome with her adoration for this remarkably ordinary and good man

the movie also serves as a strange way to take control over something inevitable yet unknowable dick johnson is going to die as we all will but he will very likely die before his physical body expires his mind will deteriorate and hell stop being dick johnson i wondered early why the movie kept resorting to slapstick with the many possible deaths of dick onscreen its more than a bit morbid for a daughter to direct her own father dying again and again in a variety of wild and bloody and violent accidents i can understand many viewers being put off by this worrying that dick is being exploited and at least finding it all to be in bad taste i tried to assess why this element was so essential to the production i suppose it functions as a gimmick that can help it get more attention and a larger audience considering the film lacks a hardcharging topic unique insider access or a headlinegrabbing name or artistic approach however as i continued with the movie i concluded that kirsten johnson is inflicting all manner of overthetop goofy deaths and violent mayhem upon her beloved father as a means of processing her looming grief shes trying to reclaim a sense of control and offering that same ownership to her father they arent running from his death but are embracing it laughing at it and doing it their way the documentary is an artifact of love and a filmmaker using art to comprehend her grief

the seventh day adventist adherence presents an interesting dynamic to explore when discussing a spiritual afterlife this smaller christian denomination believes that the worthy will return to heaven but only after jesus returns to earth to kickstart the whole armageddon deal until that fateful day the dead will lay in their graves and wait for however long it takes i had never heard about this before many religions are about delayed gratification the reward coming upon the conclusion of earthly existence and these people believe the wait extends even beyond death a lifetime and then some of waiting would shape very patient people like dick the great fear of an adventist were told is to be one of the ones left behind and its easy to see the parallels with losing ones sense of identity through the creeping fog of alzheimers apparently strict adventists also dont approve of dancing in a fantasy sequence engineered by kirsten dick gets to dance in heaven with his wife again and knowing all these details gives the moment which can be immediately silly on a surfacelevel its own sense of poignancy and reverence

the only thing that holds the movie back is that late into its 90 minutes i feel like it gets too manipulative and meta for its own good theres an emotional climax and then the movie reveals some key details that can make you feel a little bamboozled its not enough to sacrifice all the emotional investment and artistic gains that came before but its just a few steps too far dont get me wrong im genuinely happy with the overall ending but i didnt care for being jerked around

dick johnson is dead is a peculiar funny heartwarming and experimental documentary it reminded me in some ways of 2012s the act of killing where filmmaker joshua oppenheimer finds old men who participated in indonesian genocide in the 1960s to reenact their crimes but playing their victims and through the surreal prism of a film production except this movie is far more personal and far more affirming its very much a love letter to a wonderful man you feel the intimacy of this family relationship and i felt privileged just to be let in and share these moments the ordinary ones the reflective ones the emotional ones the silly ones this is an affecting documentary using its very form and function to use art to make sense of pain its currently available on netflix streaming and i would highly encourage you to relax kick your feet up like dick and watch one of the best and strangest movies of 2020

8,Dick Johnson Is Dead,100,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/dick_johnson_is_dead/reviews?type=user,ive seen johnsons debut film cameraperson a few times already when i went into it i was expecting a solid documentary but what i wasnt expecting was a thoroughly beautiful and at times transcendent experience which later became one of my 10 favorite documentaries of all time hearing that she had released a second film definitely piqued my interest while im not sure i connected with it as much as i did with cameraperson i still found it really compelling for one i found the central premise of joking about your mortality to help you to cope with it relatable while i havent joked about my past traumas and fears in the same way i find that joking about them can actually help me to cope with them whether youre referring to staging your fears as the johnsons did or simply saying a one liner about your traumas and fears to yourself or those around you this can help you to take control of them in addition to the central premise of staging elaborate death scenes other themes of death are baked into the film including flashbacks of johnsons late mother discussions with the stunt actors helping out the johnsons about their lost loved ones or a high suicide rate amongst stunt actors and dick johnson discussing how two of his past patients he worked as a psychiatrist killed themselves within these scenes though sadness doesnt appear to take priority in them so much as the empathy the johnsons treat these people with when they share their stories and the implication that those people have a good foothold on the subjects they discuss due to all of this dick johnson is dead is a meditation of coming to terms with and being able to face your mortality and past traumas fearlessly and being able to move on from them

0,Collective (Colectiv),99,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/collective_2020/reviews?type=user,"i already know the idea of watching a romanian documentary is going to be a challenge for many and thats before i mention its core subject of government reforms but this really is one of the best films of the year and worth your valuable time collective begins with a heavy metal bands pyrotechnics catching fire at a club in 2015 the title of the film and from there the aftermath leads to journalists uncovering mismanaged hospitals corrupt government officials cozy relationships between big business and the mob and preventable calamities collective is at turns fascinating horrifying dispiriting aggravating and always passionately compelling as a document of realworld journalism at the highest stages of moral righteousness

im surprised that the filmmakers managed to get such extraordinary access during such a tumultuous time this is not a documentary where the experts talk to the camera with the distance of time where the leading players recount their perspectives and contributions youre sidebyside with them in the moment as the news is being broken and challenged its am amazing example of being at the right place and the right time and then midway through the filmmakers get even more critical access the health minister is forced to resign and a new younger one is appointed in his stead vlad voiculescu is determined to learn why mistakes have happened and to correct them hes uncovering just how deep the rot goes in the layers of romanian governmental bureaucracy and hes invited the collective cameras to follow him and his staff he really seemed determined to make lasting change and their conversations have a deepsigh quality of realizing how normalized corruption has become going back and forth between the journalists uncovering the broadening extent of the corruption and the government health officials trying to enact meaningful reforms and regulations its like a good movie just reached greatness and you have the privilege to watch different sides of the crusade

i thought the movie was initially going to be about the fire at the collective club but it keeps transforming and metastasizing into something bigger and more damning early on there is footage from within the club that terrible night and it is horrifying we already know the fire and ensuing panic to escape lead to 27 people dying the initial stunned reactions build and build as the fire spreads covering the ceiling like a glowing blanket of death its one of the scariest moments of footage ive ever seen people died because the fire exits didnt exist because there was no system of safety inspections the fire very metaphorically starts small but will become something far more widespread the survivors of the fire should have been protected by the nations hospitals and medical care and yet so many more died because of the consequences of corruption the journalist team uncovers dilution of disinfectants meaning the hospitals are awash in powerfully resistant bacteria the hospital managers claimed otherwise and the initial minister of health pushes back saying these same managers tested their disinfectants and they were up to code from there it just grows and grows as more people in the nations hospital system come forward to confess abuses and coverups and kickbacks to a thriving mob presence there are suicides that sure look like murders later in this movie and i was not expecting that from its opening

the filmmaking is very forceful without being strident very political without being preachy and its always moving forward even when its constantly looking at the faults of the past director alexander nanau toto and his sisters the prince of nothingwood lets the story and events do the talking and we never break from the verité approach a person is never directly talking to the camera there are never any infographics or visual inserts the editing is precise and every scene gives you exactly what you need though sometimes it might take a little while to understand the full context of the scene and the leap in time from the prior scene the movie is 110 minutes and it feels like its sprinting because there is so much to cover it doesnt make the movie feel like its spread too thin or were missing important deliberation and context but it does require a viewer to stay more active to jump from moment to moment those 110 minutes are a clear indictment and examination on corruption and government negligence but it lets the totality of the details and the horrors convey its message rather than overt appeals

its in the concluding ten minutes that perhaps collective reaches its most depressing and most damning point there will be spoilers going forward with this paragraph for the second half of the film weve been following our crusading new health minister try and shake up a corrupt system and install real reforms that will improve the lives of the romanian citizens its inspiring and makes you go ah at least there are still good men in the world capable of enacting good when they are summoned to a level of power and authority it looks like hes actually making real changes because there are many forces pushing against his dismantling of the status quo those that benefit from the graft and corruption of the old system including criminal elements deeply entwined in the countrys infrastructure push back through their media allies and broadcasting personalities start questioning whether the health minister is being controlled by foreign influence its familiar to those who have watched the outer reaches of conservative media over the past few decades romanias own fox news and its the same kind of slimy nationalistic and xenophobic rhetoric meant to alarm and distract an election is looming in the coming weeks and our new health minister says the regulations can only be implemented if his party the socialist democrats retain power then they dont they lose by a lot like a historical loss it was 2016 where nationalistic antiimmigration forces swept into government across the world and collective ends on the depressing note without any silver lining of resolution the hospital appoints a manager who is legally unable to manage a hospital just like that all the hard work to break free from the intransigence has ended in a historical rebuke of the party literally trying to preserve life forget it jake its chinatown

collective is an inspiring crushing and compelling document of corruption incompetence and the difficulty of trying to turn around a system too content on not doing more the journalistic access is stunning and the movie is quietly powerful as we follow diligent politicians and reporters putting in the hard work of trying to make a difference and expose rampant maleficence by the end the good guys have taken some significant lumps though ive since read that vlad is back in the romanian government again as the minister of health what does this say about the crusaders for reform to me it says its a lot easier to go backwards once any reform is met with opposition from those who stand to benefit from a broken system continuing to remain broken its all too easy to fall back on the status quo even when its deeply problematic because its what the people know but that doesnt make it good change is a powerful force but its still worth fighting for even if powerful forces of the world manage to unfairly delay that change collective is a movie everyone should watch if they want to become a journalist or work in government and it should be on a shortlist of 2020 films to see for everyone else too

2,Host,100,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/host_2020/reviews?type=user,theres no doubt that the film scene of 2020 took a massive hit due to the covid pandemic but if theres anything positive to be taken from that impact then its rob savages hugely impressive horror flick host conceived and shot in the early months of covid this manages to tap into the zeitgeist and turn a tried and tested formula into something fresh and innovative although this isnt entirely a foundfootage horror its a very close relative and for anyone that feels that theyve reached burn out on that particular style i implore them to give it another try  savage keeps his premise simple his running time short and his frights genuinely chilling a very clever contemporary horror and if rob savage can do this on a shoestring budget who knows what hes capable of next

it ends the way you expectwell the way i expected i like movies that have no heroes and spoiler alert everyone dies thats the saw way  no anti heroes no back stories no music to scare you we just get to it that is how this short movie posing as a zoom call can work in their 45 minute frame of time 

there are sequels built into this because it isnt clear what happened to haley or the medium jemma plays too much so i knew how that was gonna turn out  other wise if you dig jump scares and surprise twists and turns you will enjoy this"

around the 5 or 10 minute mark one of the only two characters there so far literally says let me check my email and then we sit and watch her get on her phone and sit there reading for a minute or more omg omg omg

2,The Forty-Year-Old Version,98,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_forty_year_old_version/reviews?type=user,tedious boring no reason for it to be in black and whitejust makes the whole thing drabber
3,The Forty-Year-Old Version,98,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_forty_year_old_version/reviews?type=user,just great funny biting and touching the film follows blank through autobiographical ups and downs of aging and finding levity with career art romance and relationships
4,The Forty-Year-Old Version,98,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_forty_year_old_version/reviews?type=user,historical and personally poignant a little too indi for its on good at times
5,The Forty-Year-Old Version,98,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_forty_year_old_version/reviews?type=user,written directed and starring radha blank this comedy about a failed new york playwright who decides to become a rapper is as insightful as it is hilarious an absolute delight  pounce
6,The Forty-Year-Old Version,98,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_forty_year_old_version/reviews?type=user,the fortyyearold version turned out to be a pleasant surprise  radha blank wrote produced directed and starred in this fine freshman film that seems to have come out of nowhere  it comes across as some sort of weird spike leewoody allen hybrid with sharp dialogue and strong social commentary  blank has a magnetic presence on the screen which helps to breathe life into every scene  despite the fact that her directing style may not be fully realized yet for example one scene appears to have been shot from the reflection in a mirror which seems kind of odd and not very effective she is a film presence worth making note of
7,The Forty-Year-Old Version,98,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_forty_year_old_version/reviews?type=user,a total waste of time sorry for the rap lovers an art form i would never understand
8,The Forty-Year-Old Version,98,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_forty_year_old_version/reviews?type=user,in what has to be the best cinematic debut of the year radha blank truly shines in the 40yearold version her script is very sophisticated poignant and grounded in reality while her direction is also strong her acting performance is fantastic and scenestealing the film works as both a witty and lighthearted comedy but also as this far from clichéd autobiographical flick that really gets what it is like being an aspiring artist it is fueled by honesty in its every scene and that was truly commendable
9,The Forty-Year-Old Version,98,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_forty_year_old_version/reviews?type=user,amazing amazing amazing shocked to not see it as a favorite to win or even be nominated for best pictue
0,Saint Frances,99,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/saint_frances/reviews?type=user,ordinarily theres a good chance i wouldve overlooked this film as it really didnt strike me as something of interest however some positive word of mouth and its availability on netflix convinced me otherwise and im very glad i gave it a chance this is a delightfully refreshing human story thats told with an abundance of wit and honesty and its very positive to witness a female centric film that addresses everything from menstruation to abortion with a genuine honesty and nonjudgmental approach anchored by two performances of great substance and nuance by kelly osullivan who also wrote the screenplay and young ramona edith williams as the titular frances two superb performances that bring out the heart and soul of the film
1,Saint Frances,99,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/saint_frances/reviews?type=user,what a beautiful film  highly recommended  easily one of the best films of the year that you may not hear about  seek it out
2,Saint Frances,99,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/saint_frances/reviews?type=user,absolutely incredible such an inspiring and beautifully crafted movie that deftly explores so many real and weighty issues with aplomb unbridled compassion and real warmth i laughed i felt pride and i cried kelly osullivan has stolen my heart and im genuinely pleased she has
3,Saint Frances,99,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/saint_frances/reviews?type=user,"pretty wonderful all around saint frances lived up to my high standards for the sunday night movie kelly osullivan comes really out of nowhere for me to not only give a stellar performance in the lead role but also pen this excellent screenplay and throw in an executive producer credit as well 
other fine performances came from charin alvarez lily mojekwu max lipchitz and especially the rather precocious sorry but it really fits her ramona edith williams as francesfrannie
great use of tone here along with a delicate but pragmatic touch with sensitive though very natural recurring experiences that will no doubt be offputting for some still in the hands of some directors such subject matter couldve been handled mishandled clumsily taking away from the overall effect of the film extra credit there for director thompson but im thinking a lot of that can be traced to working with osullivan who again was fantastic 
much the same can be said of the religious elements that come into play i never really felt that the screenplay got preachy or didactic in any catholicnonsecular way i even felt the scene in the confession as just another case of bridget getting more relief and absolution of a sort that was needed she may lie a lot and need to work on why but shes also brave which she needs to never change 
the unnecessary last scene between bridget and frannie seemed a  bit of a stretch for me but ill offset that with the scene with good ol busybody joan in the park clam up joan 4 stars"
4,Saint Frances,99,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/saint_frances/reviews?type=user,fantastic characture of a woman trying to cope with adulthood and the consequences of her actions lighthearted but fierce when it needs to be this movie will run you through the emotional gauntlet more than once i found myself cracking up while my cheeks were still a little soggy from tear trails induced by a recent scene good stuff i wont soons forget this indie gem
5,Saint Frances,99,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/saint_frances/reviews?type=user,an absolute joy this film will make you laugh and cry in equal measure its superb
6,Saint Frances,99,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/saint_frances/reviews?type=user,i didnt much care for the fairly shallow and mostly clueless characters and why saint francis that was never clear conventional and tedious
7,Saint Frances,99,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/saint_frances/reviews?type=user,propaganda over entertainment  very unlikable main character  does have some funny moments and the little girl is adorable
8,Saint Frances,99,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/saint_frances/reviews?type=user,this is a beautiful story  and everything from the screenplay to the acting did it justice its really about every stage of life and the great human drama that we all experience loved it rock and roll babyyyyy

0,Driveways,100,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/driveways/reviews?type=user,a movie with bottomless compassion for its characters and the audience the story feels both familiar and new probably because of the way it lingers on certain small moments of pain or joy
1,Driveways,100,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/driveways/reviews?type=user,loved this movie so much
2,Driveways,100,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/driveways/reviews?type=user,excellent grab your heart and not let go
3,Driveways,100,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/driveways/reviews?type=user,that policeman was shot  years ago by john rambo
4,Driveways,100,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/driveways/reviews?type=user,"ive realized over the decades that theres a particular type of movie that i respond to emotionally perhaps more than any others  that doesnt mean i  cry more when i see them or that im more on the edge of my seat or anything like that  its a feeling inside that makes me remember the movie long after ive finished  i call them my trip to bountiful movies  many years ago when that film came out i said to my parents that i really like it and recommended it  my dad asked what is it you liked so much and i said its a little movie about everyday people being very kind to other everyday people  the main character goes through a journey thats difficult for her and she makes it when strangers she meets along the way are simply kind to her  it moves me

driveways is that kind of film  singlemom asianamerican kathy hong chau and her eight year old son cody lucas jaye arrive in a small upstate new york town to clean out the house of kathys recently deceased much older sister  the two sisters have barely known each other as adults and kathy immediately discovers that her sister was a hoarder so the job of cleaning the house in order to sell it immediately becomes 10x more daunting than she expected  kathy doesnt earn much money she is a medical transcriptionist and so the little family must camp at the house  the neighbor to one side is a busybody christine ebersole but to her other side is del a korean war vet widower brian dennehy who lives a life of quiet occasionally broken by trips to the vfw to play bingo  

he befriends cody a very intelligent young man who is also extremely socially shy  hes not i dont think on the spectrumhes just very reluctant to make friends his own age and very intimidated by the notion of of boys physicality as in roughhousing  the nosy neighbor has two rambunctious grandsons and their wrestling activities pretty normal stuff for boys of 10 years old causes so much anxiety in young cody that he vomits  del who isnt looking for a friend still easily takes this studious kid into his home so his mom can take care of the chores she needs to  the three form a bond that comes so naturally and it one based on mutual kindness and mutual need  del didnt know he needed this kid and yes his mom too to be part of his life and kathy sure didnt know she needed an 80something widower to help her son

the movie is great in many ways but one of the things i enjoyed most is the character of kathy  she has a believable economic situation a job she can do remotely but that doesnt pay incredibly well  she is a far from perfect mom  she cusses in front of her kid and really is at a loss as to how to bring him out of his shell  but she also knows that she must love him and show him he is loved if hes ever to overcome his shyness  and on top of that she sneaks off to go to the bar just to blow off some steam  shes smart and has a razorsharp sense of sarcasm  but shes vulnerable and you can really feel how close she is to the family not being able to make it financially  hong chau is a revelation in this film and i look forward to seeking our more of her work

young lucas jaye is very good as wellone might say hes even a little too polished as an actor at his age  or it could be that his character is the most extreme of the 3  i understand his mother well and i understand del  but do i 100 buy the character of cody  well maybe i only buy it 95  still pretty good

and brian dennehy is so good  in about 5 seconds you feel his pride his loneliness his sadness and his intrinsic goodness  he isnt one of the cliched characters of the gruff old man who softens after long resistance to the charms of opening up and making new friends this isnt eastwood in grand torino  hes quiet and keeps to himself sure  but he is quick to make himself useful to the family  he takes the boy in and gives him just the right balance of treating him like a man and treating him like a kid  nothing earthshattering happens  there are no scenes of having to rush the kid to the hospital or chasing off bullies or anything big  its just a series of everyday encounters and kindnesses exchanged back and forth  

this movie is slow paced but not for one moment did my interest flag  its only 83 minutes for starters but i immediately cared about all three characters and everything they did was presented so specifically that i really felt i was looking in on the private lives of three small but enjoyable people

in the end the feeling of the film is the lesson the film has to offer  life goes on and its often filled with uninteresting things and occasionally darkened by bad things death of a spouse a cluttered house money problems  but it is also full of little joys brought about by simply hanging out with other people and treating them kindly   its just a feelgood movie  the end is quietly bittersweet  as i said life goes on but is a mixture of highs and lows  we see that played out quietly but powerfully  and dennehy gets to make a speech at the end thats a bit stunning  its quiet but powerful and is unexpectedly moving  

if you want to see a good movie about good but flawed people grappling with lifes highs and lows one with plenty of humorplease check out driveways  i sure enjoyed the heck out of it"
5,Driveways,100,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/driveways/reviews?type=user,a gentle touching story about a lonely 8yearold boy and his single mother who travel out of town to empty the house of a recently deceased relative and end up befriending their late relations nextdoor neighbor a widowed 80something korean war vet this moving tale exudes warmth as the three lonesome protagonists grow close to one another filling a huge void in each others lives however director andrew ahns latest is far from an exercise in schmaltz or obvious manipulation though some of the pictures themes are familiar theyre often handled in unconventional ways and always addressed with deft skill and subtlety there are a few elements that could have used a little further development and the ending  though effective  seems to come somewhat suddenly however these shortcomings aside driveways is a genuine pleasure especially for its performances most notably that of brian dennehy in one of his last roles its a fine offering worthy of its two 2019 independent spirit award nominations now available on cable tv and streaming online
6,Driveways,100,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/driveways/reviews?type=user,in brian dennehys last film he plays del a recently widowed war veteran he lives next door to a woman who dies suddenly her sister kathy and 8yearold son cody show up to take care of her estate cody who tends to keep to himself and doesnt easily take to the two teenagers who live down the street goes over to dels after one particularly nasty encounter and the two of them begin to form a friendship the film is a character study and the three leads help elevate the story into something that feels fresh real and relevant i really enjoyed watching the friendship that develops between cody and del and how the three leads become changed by that relationship thumbs up from me for a film that moves slowly and tells a sweet story without it ever becoming sappy
7,Driveways,100,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/driveways/reviews?type=user,a pleasant surprise and a movie im sure wont get the attention it deserves driveways is a heartfelt and moving comingofage drama with solid character depth realistic emotions and strong performances by its three leads with the late great brian dennehy giving a satisfying final performance
8,Driveways,100,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/driveways/reviews?type=user,"andrew ahns second full length and a film that has gotten some recognition lately the lonely eight year old cody travels with his mom to clean out his aunts house after she died they clean up the messy place and even if thats not a fun matter they share some good times together cody is not good at making friends and kids around this place is no good match for him the best match is the neighbour del  an old war vet

its a gentle and calm film not the biggest of happenings but very stable real and you kind of never miss those big scenes its short and sweet well acted and it has a lot of heart  making it something worth to observe not something very special and theres plenty of films that has the same flavour but it works just fine as it keeps you interested

7 out of 10 dead cats"
9,Driveways,100,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/driveways/reviews?type=user,"an utterly charming film and a heartfelt performance from the late brian dennehy boost driveways into a must see  at only 83 minutes its a breeze  hong chau and
lucas jaye play mother and son  all three leads are terrific  credit to andrew ahn who knows exactly how to shoot his characters  for whatever reason its not a sad movie in the least but it broke me in half  the final monologue is so perfect i want to see an oscar nomination in the very least for dennehy  final score 9210"
0,Totally Under Control,99,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/totally_under_control/reviews?type=user,its unsettling to see revisionist history happening in real time i was halfway through this before i realized it was a mockumentary i thought it was going to be legit when i started it even as a liberal i found it incredibly biased and extremely dishonest
1,Totally Under Control,99,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/totally_under_control/reviews?type=user,"i think this is a well researched documentary  i also think you walk away from this feeling the same way most all the experts who the production team interviewed in this film 

trumps nonstop downplaying of the real threat of covid19 and the right wing news machines loop of constantly discredeting the doctors scientist and experts 
lead america to its embarrassing disastrous response to the epidemic of 2020  

history will not be kind to trump and his enablers"
2,Totally Under Control,99,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/totally_under_control/reviews?type=user,biased trump hit piece short on any of the actual science glosses over any faults not attributed to trump and attributed to bureaucracycdc fda etc emphasizes and distorts minor faults  although there are definitely some fair pointscriticisms   and goes out of its way to distort positive things or to cryptically blame the economic guys the comparison to south korea is fairly brief and disappears later in the documentary as it descends into blatant politically biased slander fails to take a broad look at mistakes that were made and positive actions that were taken all over the world and doesnt give any sort of overview or neutral outlook on the virus and pandemics in general were still in the midst of the pandemic but trump bad everything is his fault and systemic racism very very onesided and lacking in substance
3,Totally Under Control,99,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/totally_under_control/reviews?type=user,should play in prime time on every network if you havent voted yet this should be required viewing every american deserves to know the truth of our governments covid response this film peels back the curtain using documentation and film that cannot be denied
4,Totally Under Control,99,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/totally_under_control/reviews?type=user,this documentary is an absolute must see it exposes the mistakes made by the current administration and many government agencies to handle covid19 it includes facts to support any opinions made and includes many experts at the top of their field despite remaining on top of the news through this pandemic i learned of many personally unknown efforts and failures by the administration to handle the virus
5,Totally Under Control,99,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/totally_under_control/reviews?type=user,i expected to watch a couple minutes before moving on to something more fun instead i was glued to the screen for two hours weve all lived through it but its clarifying to see the disaster unfold daybyday sometimes even hourbyhour some of the bungles are simply mind boggling for example we hear from one of the young volunteers volunteers who were put in charge by jared of procuring ppe for our ravaged hospitals meanwhile we see nurses crying in front of hospitals where they tried to use garbage bags as ppe garbage bags and eventually we see governors smuggling in supplies  ultimately the picture of what went wrong is all too clear
6,Totally Under Control,99,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/totally_under_control/reviews?type=user,absolutely horrible very little facts and extraordinarily biased
7,Totally Under Control,99,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/totally_under_control/reviews?type=user,this movie is total garbage its basically one giant covid documentary directed at bashing president trump the entire film is just painting him as the bad guy dont get me wrong hindsight is a beautiful thing and im sure the us could have done things differently but wow this movie is blatantly a political move from the opposition to make trump look terrible right be this election very biased
8,Totally Under Control,99,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/totally_under_control/reviews?type=user,"we obviously all know how much our current administration has fucked us all over and made the pandemic way more of a nightmare than it needed to be but this still shed light on many things i didnt know about regarding everything that was ignored to save lives earlier this year when covid hit this might be one of the most important documentaries ever made for not only exposing one of the most heinous and fraudulent acts of united states presidency but doing so in such an accurate and timely fashion

vote blue for the love of god"

0,The Vast of Night,92,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_vast_of_night/reviews?type=user,if you like scifi at all  even if you have never heard of twilight zone  or like good mysteries just watch it  give the 1950s mood building at the beginning a chance to ease you in  the pace will soon pick up and you will be hooked by the acting which was great by the filming style which is unusual and amazingly effective  the long shots on the streets was done with a camera on a gocart that came from a actual person in the town in texas where it was shot  so many clever things to watch for that you might miss  reminders of war of the worlds radio stn wotw very low budget but it doesnt matter and maybe adds to the ambience  what a great movie  more mystery on why the basketball star kevin durant is listed at the end of the credits so much fun in this movie in so many places really impressed by actor sierra mccormick fay  switchboard operator in this film
1,The Vast of Night,92,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_vast_of_night/reviews?type=user,a great period piece with subtle twilight zone qualities
2,The Vast of Night,92,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_vast_of_night/reviews?type=user,the vast of night has great pacing until the beginning of the third act which suddenly comes to a sluggish expositive halt the characters are some great plucky teenagers  kind of geeky enthusiastic and showing genuine curiosity about the world and universe the twilight zone technique or in this movie the paradox zone had potential but overall made everything feel a little too safe the potential was in the signal  the twilight zone takes place in the airwaves between light and dark between signal and source  in a mysterious inbetween place instead the vast of night by putting the story on a tv inside the movie doesnt let us believe whats  happening the twilight zone tv show has some great wtf moments because the narrative intro puts us right in the middle of the airwaves to see whats really happening in those inbetween places vast of night puts up too many layers or safety buffers to be concerned about whats happening theyre good characters but they arent real the effect the buffer has on the story is diminishing
3,The Vast of Night,92,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_vast_of_night/reviews?type=user,quirky takes 30 mins to get into the style but stuck with it and youll be rewarded its pure class stylish and different with the exciting freshness of a new director
4,The Vast of Night,92,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_vast_of_night/reviews?type=user,boring and predictable
5,The Vast of Night,92,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_vast_of_night/reviews?type=user,it wont be every ones cup of tea filmed in a very natural style i watched it with my 20yr old son and we both loved it and wondered why i had actively had to search it out it seems to knit together very well stories of alien visits secret govt sites and abductions i liked the styling and kitsch props etc well worth a viewing
6,The Vast of Night,92,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_vast_of_night/reviews?type=user,"this was long and plodding and took forever  i think people are giving this a higher rating because of the nostalgia feel it has

you can skip this movie and not miss anything of value"
7,The Vast of Night,92,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_vast_of_night/reviews?type=user,the performances by jake horowitz and especially sierra mccormick were gratifying enough to obscure a flimsy premise and a deficient conclusion the unconventional cinematography made for some creepy if not tiresome monologues i recommend this only if you are in the mood for an experimental delivery supported by strong acting
8,The Vast of Night,92,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_vast_of_night/reviews?type=user,with its twilight zone feel the vast of night set in the 1950s satisfies on several levels especially the direction of firsttimer andrew patterson the two leads sierra mccormick and jake horowitz are solid and take advantage of a wordy script that succeeds despite lengthy blocks of dialogue not allowed in mainstream film they also have good chemistry though there is not thankfully a whiff of romance between them in addition the ending is mighty cool theres a lot to like about this lowbudget gem
9,The Vast of Night,92,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_vast_of_night/reviews?type=user,nothing compelling has happened whatsoever and im 45 minutes into this 90 minute movie    nothing worth watching  if i stop watching now i will have no concern that i wont find out what happens in the 2nd half of the movie because there is just no narrative at all that i am caught up in  just nothing has happened  im probably going to give it another 5 minutes then turn it off  i regret having started it waste of time
0,Welcome to Chechnya,100,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/welcome_to_chechnya/reviews?type=user,welcome to chechnya documents the persecution of gay men and lesbian women in chechnya a republic of the russian federation it follows the moscow community center lgbt group and their efforts to shelter gay people in danger including grisha later revealed to be maxim lapunov an event planner who is not even ethnically chechnyan the story is powerful gripping and tense and at times hard to watch especially when they intercut candid footage of gays being beat up
1,Welcome to Chechnya,100,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/welcome_to_chechnya/reviews?type=user,welcome to chechnya offers a tragic intense and important look into the atrocious gay purges happening in this questionable region the film needed to have more facts in it and it is overly modern in approach but that still mostly worked as the thriller elements are successfully executed many scenes here are very suspenseful and moving and the movies use of vfx is very strong and unique
2,Welcome to Chechnya,100,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/welcome_to_chechnya/reviews?type=user,some of the bravest men and women i have ever seen a sobering documentary that everyone should see
3,Welcome to Chechnya,100,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/welcome_to_chechnya/reviews?type=user,shocking infuriating and extremely important the cruelty experienced by chechnyas lgbt community should be known by all who care about human rights and dignity 
4,Welcome to Chechnya,100,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/welcome_to_chechnya/reviews?type=user,its hard to write a review because this is an important subject matter but i think it was a very poorly made documentary for a very important subject it was very traumatic to watch because of how it focused on certain very violent graphic scenes rather than presenting the subjects as people i wanted to learn more about the victims their lives rather than being force fed horrific videos many of the videos should come with a warning  there is a scene of an attempted suicide with graphic video involving blood there is a very very graphic scene showing a rape happening involving a man this to me was very concerning i dont believe this video would have been shown if it was a woman what does this serve to show these very graphic videos there are so many graphic videos online of people being killed or tortured to the point where it is almost porn to some people and it encourages desensitization and it is very traumatic to view for people who may have experienced these things or who are sensitive there are no warnings when you watch the film however so i am warning you now i would have rather read about these issues than ever watch this film i used to work for an international tribunal on genocide and war crimes so i am no stranger to reading about horrific things but i try to understand the issues rather than have graphic imagery being forcefed to me i did make a donation to the center after watching the film i hope to learn more about the stories about the people involved in the film from articles or a better made film in the future that doesnt try to reduce the people to graphic scenes it reminds me of the american version of the movie traffic that focused on violence and divisiveness versus the british series that actually captured the stories inclusively and explained the situation better
5,Welcome to Chechnya,100,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/welcome_to_chechnya/reviews?type=user,the whole world should be aware of this outrage that nobody knows about  its unbelievable that these things keep happening

0,Time,98,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/time_2020/reviews?type=user,"sibil fox rich richardson is the striking subject of this impressionistic documentary from director garrett bradley mixing home movies and new footage the film charts the 21 yearlong journey of fox to secure the release of her husband robert from the louisiana state penitentiary where he had been serving out an extraordinary sixty year sentence for armed robbery

unfortunately the film does not make as good a case as it could for the injustice of roberts sentence he and fox both did indeed rob a bank in a moment of desperation fox served several years in prison herself for the crime but unexplained in the film is that this was roberts first offence nobody was physically harmed the amount stolen was 5000and that a plea deal for 10 to 18 years was initially offered before a second attorney somehow managed to screw up the case so badly that this was increased to a life sentence the cost by the way of keeping someone in prison in louisiana for 21 years is somewhere in the region of 350000

instead of these explanations we get a meditation on the way prison affects the lives of those left behind on the outside fox is left to raise their six children including twins justus and freedom by herself by the time director bradley catches up with the story the twins are already grown up one of them a dentistry graduate and the other a polisci major both of them look set to have impressive careers ahead of them but fox is the real star here once out of prison she became a fierce advocate for her husband and against the injustices of the prison system she speaks with the fire and passion of a southern preacher to anyone who will listen

by far the punishment that seemed to have had the most impact on her was the conversations she had with the people at the bank whose lives she and her husbands crime touched but the depravations of prison life and the healing effects of restorative justice are barely explored here bradley preferring to watch fox wait and wait and wait on the phone for some news about her husbands latest appeal depicting the depersonalised agony of this legal limbo is interesting to an extent and its clear that this is what bradley set out to do but im not sure that this film is really going to change anyones minds about prison the way fox and robert may wish it to the footage assembled by bradley is so diffuse and unfocused that the end result feels almost abstractand with a character as compelling as fox at the films centre that feels like a bit of a missed opportunity"

this aint a must see its a must witness"
2,Time,98,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/time_2020/reviews?type=user,garrett bradleys first documentary feature time is more than just about one individual its about the criminal justice system and how its broken  if you are blind or willfully ignorant and you give this 1 star or 12 star odds are you didnt do more than read a summary about it or are a racist  theres nothing wrong with this other than the camera work is a little shaky and even thats can be easily forgiven when you understand a lot of the footage wasnt meant to be in a movie  whenever i watch a film about the justice system and its disproportionate discipline to people of color i always recommend watching 13th  that is the gold standard for all docs in this genre  a worthwhile film here for those who enjoy a great story  final score 7710
3,Time,98,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/time_2020/reviews?type=user,"this is such a moving film its gives a window into the lives of a family affected by longterm incarceration the spirit and exceptionalism of this family overcomes and inspires

i was saddened to see so little compassion in many of the reviews and that many one star reviews were given based on a do the crime do the time mentality rather than on the merits of the film itself it made me wonder if the reviewers actually watched the film so ill focus on the argument made by the bulk of the reviews the subjects of this documentary never said that they shouldnt have been punished for their crime there is true remorse shown and heartfelt apologies no one denied the terrible choices that were made the story shows the longlasting effects of a purely punitive rather than restorative justice system it gives a personal story and a deeper understanding to an often misunderstood subject in the united states 

there is also the injustice of unreasonably long sentences given to black people sentencing has been proven to be harsher for black people than for white people find the united states sentancing commission report on the us governments website

there is a problem when a wealthy white man is sentenced to six months in prison for raping a woman because the judge was worried about the effect the conviction would have on his life but a black man with a family to support who acted out of financial desperation and didnt hurt anyone is given sixty years sixty years in prison is effectively a life sentence according to the report the police arrived at the scene of the robbery within a minute and no one was injured 

if you take issue with the themes of this film i would recommend the documentary 13th by ava duvernay"
4,Time,98,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/time_2020/reviews?type=user,"a desperate and begging plea for empathy in a country that seems to have less and less every day chronicling the injustices and flabbergasting failures of a justice system that doesnt seem to earn the title of justice in any form 

 if you do not feel for this couple their struggle their love their redemption and unrelenting fight you really need to do some soul searching for your own sense of empathy i wouldnt wish the pain that this couple went through on any of my worst enemies this should be required viewing for every high schooler and older american so they can truly grasp the actions of this justice system that is supposedly so fair and just 

this was the most moving documentary that ive ever seen and more please watch"
5,Time,98,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/time_2020/reviews?type=user,they committed a serious crime and deserved to go to jail they werent committing robbery because they were hungry they wanted money quickly to open a boutique it was a stupid choice and im sure they regret it now but it was a free choice
6,Time,98,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/time_2020/reviews?type=user,the couple who are the subjects of this documentary committed an armed robbery of a credit union because they wanted the money to start a hip hop themed clothing business they were caught and sent to prison the husband is the one who walked into the business with a gun and threatened to kill people so he got a long sentence his wife was the getaway driver so she only got a few years the documentary maker presents them as victims and treats their crime as though its a trivial mistake armed robbery is an extremely serious crime and often ends in death serious injury and lifelong psychological trauma this documentary ignores the victims and their suffering and uncritically endorses mrs richs belief that armed robbers like her husband should not be sent to prison
7,Time,98,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/time_2020/reviews?type=user,"sixty years is a very harsh sentence when many criminals are getting five for murder which is baffling the wife was fortunate she got a lighter term

i dont get the attitude though they seem confused over whose fault this was it was their decision wasnt it how about the innocents who are traumatized injured or even killed in robberies some of them never get over it it ruins their lives"
8,Time,98,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/time_2020/reviews?type=user,if you do the crime be prepared to do the time this couple made their choice and of their own free will they robbed a bank what did they expect would happen if they were caught the woman is a prison abolitionist and the documentary makers never ask serious questions about what the consequences would be if there were no prisons and people who committed serious crimes could continue to walk free and victimize more people
9,Time,98,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/time_2020/reviews?type=user,these kind of documentaries can seriously frustrate me which is the point regarding the negligence and inequality of our justice system when films like this put you deep into the lives of those directly affected by that broken system its so hard to walk away feeling anything but complete despair time gave me the opposite feeling as i walked away not that part of this didnt make me mad at the system as it should but the way garrett bradley structures this piece and makes it a poetic time capsule and collage of memories hopelessness with times of hope and empowerment and something that transcends the documentary format gave me so many emotions that at the end of the film i just felt complete beauty from it this is truly an amazing work of art that is so much more than just an examination of how broken our justice system is

1,All In: The Fight for Democracy,100,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/all_in_the_fight_for_democracy/reviews?type=user,all americans need to watch this film
2,All In: The Fight for Democracy,100,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/all_in_the_fight_for_democracy/reviews?type=user,a very important film thats well worth seeing for anyone interested in american politics its really so depressing to see how effective voter suppression is over there the confederates may have lost their right to keep slaves but they and their political descendants have clearly done everything they can to stop black people and other ethnic minorities from voting
3,All In: The Fight for Democracy,100,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/all_in_the_fight_for_democracy/reviews?type=user,it is an eye opener on how real is voter suppression in america it is a call to action to people to vote and to politicians to protect and respect the will of the voters  i only gave it 4 stars because it did not open the mic to the other side  it is only fair to have both sides express their points on the issue  unless of course the other side refused to participate on the documentary but the producer did not make it clear they asked them  other than that it makes to point of showing the audience of the problem
4,All In: The Fight for Democracy,100,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/all_in_the_fight_for_democracy/reviews?type=user,when did the world become as ridiculous as a 80s weekly cop drama  this documentary is constructed in a way that is frustrating  theres a lot to sort through including the voting rights act the civil rights era and the deconstruction of the voting rights act  the through line is the 2019 georgia gubernatorial race between brian kemp and stacey abrams  that common denominator is muddled by the way the story is laid out  whenever i see films like this i say if you dont get it see 13th  if you still dont get it then you are willfully not getting it  this happens to be rushed and not as good as most in the field but its not boring and its not wrong  if thats a problem for you then your issue may be in the mirror  final score  6510
5,All In: The Fight for Democracy,100,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/all_in_the_fight_for_democracy/reviews?type=user,"with all in the fight for democracy documentarians liz garbus and lisa cortes weave a compelling account of the history of voting rights in the us a long winding path through many of the most pivotal moments and movements of the pastthrough triumph and tragedybound to infuriate audiences just as much as itll invigorate them 

the story of voting rights in this country is not brief nor simple the movie opens with a primer on georgias 2018 gubernatorial election between stacey abrams and brian kemp from there the film documents the vast journey from the dawn of our nation when the only people who could vote were white male landowners to where we are today with voting rights for all citizens over 18

its remarkable just how much garbus and cortes are able to encompass within the film from reconstruction and jim crow segregationist practices and the civil rights movement of the mid20th century up to the present day the pacing is impressive and gives the viewer a lot to take in and take away from the film but the film is never overwhelming in its scope or ambition garbus and cortes even include footage as recent as the wisconsin primary depicting voters donning facemasks at the polls its slightly surreal to see a story being told that is so heavily informed by the headlines of today the films most engaging perspective comes not from that of a voter but a politician in that of stacey abrams her point of view anchors the film as living proof of the consequences of voter suppression the importance of voting demonstrated throughout gives urgency to all in and i commend the editing considering how much the situation surrounding voter suppression and the fight for voting rights was still developing in the months leading up to the films release

all in the fight for democracy affirms the power of ones vote and shows how much traction has been gained in establishing wider voting rights the film also demonstrates the degree to which the everpresent threat of voter suppression has grown and the ways in which it plagues the elections of today illustrated by the gubernatorial race between abrams and kemp michael waldman utters a sentence early on in the film that encapsulates nicely the films thesis history is never a straight line its always a fight history repeats itself just as often as it progresses and that notion is crystallized within this film at various points where the film jumps back in time to show how the past has informed the present all in closes with a crystalclear message to go vote an acute reminder that all in cant close the door on its story precisely because the fight referred to in the films title is still ongoing much work has been done in the realm of voting rights but much more still remains to be done the film doesnt lose sight of that 

i give all in the fight for democracy 4 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 12 to 18 for some brief violent images from newsreels and archives this is timely illuminating documentary filmmaking covering a pressing issue and definitely a mustsee not just for the information it contains but the skill with which its presented all in the fight for democracy is available to amazon prime subscribers starting september 18 2020

0,Athlete A,100,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/athlete_a/reviews?type=user,compelling and emotional it highlights the bravery of the survivors the tenacity of the investigative repprters and the power that documentary filmmaking has to speak truth to power
1,Athlete A,100,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/athlete_a/reviews?type=user,it was a good documentary which gave me chills to hear about the abuse towards young girls what was the most horrible part of it was the coverup campaign of the organisation
2,Athlete A,100,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/athlete_a/reviews?type=user,one of the best sports documentaries ive seen its a shocking subject but they dont reveal too much of the nasty bits but also showed the aftermath and how the girls have recovered since now there just needs to be a full investigation into american gymnastics
3,Athlete A,100,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/athlete_a/reviews?type=user,athlete a is a documentary that covers a disturbing subject that i didnt know anything about i think on a technical level this is a fairly wellmade documentary even though i am not the best person to judge them because i usually dont watch many that often i think more than anything else the movie feels like one of the more essential documentaries out there because it covers an important and timely subject matter its one of those stories that showcase good journalism and sheds light on a topic that is important even if it is pretty tough to watch at times
4,Athlete A,100,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/athlete_a/reviews?type=user,athlete a is an insightful watch as well as another step towards an overdue reckoning for all the sexual predators in power equally disturbing and heartbreaking this journalistic documentary is flipping good

0,First Cow,95,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/first_cow/reviews?type=user,it has some snooty film festivalworthy traits but its the slowest moving movie youll ever watch
1,First Cow,95,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/first_cow/reviews?type=user,what a waste of two hours of my life the premise had great film written all over itthe script and the execution on the other hand failed beyond belief frankly the film proved that you can make a bad film from a good script but you can never make a good film from a bad script not sure who is to blame for this film  the director the producer or the writer i have seen bad notes and bad execution lay waste to many worthy scripts i would like to read the script first draft to eliminate the writeri have a feeling the director was the chief culprit
2,First Cow,95,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/first_cow/reviews?type=user,"first cow is such an unusual film im guessing for the low view ratings  starting in present day with the discovery of two skeletons the viewer knows how the movie ends two loners meet up in 1820s oregon wilderness and talk about their dreams for a future of a better life  it starts with the first cow in the territory and doughnut like pastry
this was a special movie"
3,First Cow,95,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/first_cow/reviews?type=user,another one where the critics whooped it up but the paying publicdidnt i was fooled by the trailer which makes the film look like it has some pace about itself  2 men meet different cultures different backgrounds and then go and make their fortune or not that is what i was expected but no slow pace lots of shots in darkness so you cant really see mumbling about maybe we should leave but they never do the whole plot revolves around them stealing milk from a local landowners  cow and eventutally the get found out thats it it isnt about the american frontier a la paint your wagon it is okay but just okay a typical critics film
4,First Cow,95,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/first_cow/reviews?type=user,beautifully filmed and delicately acted first cow is a peaceful and beautiful minimalist picture that brings a realistic and human lens to the often embellished and mythicized american frontier
5,First Cow,95,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/first_cow/reviews?type=user,i couldnt even get through the opening 15 min  slow  slow  slow and pretentious
6,First Cow,95,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/first_cow/reviews?type=user,good story good ending good depiction of the time too slow filmed in way too much darkness
7,First Cow,95,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/first_cow/reviews?type=user,slowburn and simply beautiful a very bottled production with a modest and clean performance by the main protagonist
8,First Cow,95,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/first_cow/reviews?type=user,it is a very slow paced movie but it kept me interested throughout nice cinematography and good acting perhaps it is just my hearing but i found it difficult to understand all of the dialogue at times when it seemed as if they were mumbling
9,First Cow,95,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/first_cow/reviews?type=user,o filme tem uma linda fotografia a imersão na época é muito bem feita cenários figurino perfeitos mas a história é muito arrastada os diálogos são entediantes e trama é rasa não entendo tanto frenesi da crítica filme que será esquecido rapidamente
0,Corpus Christi (Boze cialo),98,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/corpus_christi_2020/reviews?type=user,excellent movie for a relatively young crew this movie really has it all thought provoking engaging challenging at times and ultimately provides for introspection
1,Corpus Christi (Boze cialo),98,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/corpus_christi_2020/reviews?type=user,lovely polish countryside local taboo and a beyond belief real story
2,Corpus Christi (Boze cialo),98,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/corpus_christi_2020/reviews?type=user,the lead is tremendous the rest of the cast is very good as well it probably will not please the extremely devout it is a thinking mans film about faith  and redemption
3,Corpus Christi (Boze cialo),98,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/corpus_christi_2020/reviews?type=user,absolute ripper of a movie deep and meaningful topics that left you awake half the night thinking through all that happened the would be priest was just what jc would have wanted
4,Corpus Christi (Boze cialo),98,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/corpus_christi_2020/reviews?type=user,the film paces itself perfectly and provides a very real and authentic feel when dealing with guilt and grief emotionally the film is evenly spread out and provides great payoffs through an air of mystery the plot is shrouded in however i feel that the ending changes the pace and doesnt provide an appropriate catharsis to satisfy audiences
5,Corpus Christi (Boze cialo),98,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/corpus_christi_2020/reviews?type=user,corpus christi is an extremely complex and powerful film about faith and redemption about finding a path to forgiveness and the means and ways of overcoming grief this superb polish film was nominated for best international feature film at this years academy awards and deservedly so this film by jan komasa centres on the story of daniel a young man in juvenile detention in warsaw he is released on parole to go and work at a sawmill in a small country village he has dreams of becoming a priest but his criminal record prevents him achieving this but upon entering the town he visits the local church and deceives them into thinking he is travelling priest fresh out of the seminary when the local vicar goes away for a sabbatical he takes over the parish and his youth and unconventional ways win over the locals but the town holds a dark secret a recent car crash wiped out seven young lives and the locals are still grieving this loss greatly when daniel delves deeper he find secrets and pushback from the locals this beautifully layered film exquisitely shows the effects of guilt and blame and the way faith works but also hinders its also a very personal journey for daniel a man trying to rebuild his life but unable to because of his hanuted past apart from a strong emotional power the film is also beautifully lit luminating each and every scene special credit to bartosz bielenia too in the lead role he is truly superb as is this wondrous film
6,Corpus Christi (Boze cialo),98,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/corpus_christi_2020/reviews?type=user,i loved this movie and the end has a real wow to it
7,Corpus Christi (Boze cialo),98,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/corpus_christi_2020/reviews?type=user,"im going to spoil the first 10 minutes or so of the movie for you in this paragraph i think thats okay but if you really want to see it without any idea of what its about dont read further i knew going into it what the premise was and did not find my enjoyment spoiled also this film is in polish with subtitles if you dont like subtitles and im amazed at the people who will give poor reviews simply because a film dared to not be in english dont bother this film focuses on a young man who is a convict about to be paroled work in a factory in a small town although certainly a sinful man and its never in doubt that he is in fact sinful hes also got a religious fervor and interest so much so hes applied to allowed into theology school in order to become a priest thats denied and hes sent off to the factory he cant bring himself to show up and quickly finds himself taken in by the household of the town priestthey think hes a visiting priest and next thing you know hes on the pulpit serving mass

this is not a comedy and despite one or two light moments its a pretty heavy film the townspeople are still recovering from a local tragedy and theres lots of blame and accusation flying around everyone is weighted down and held back by anger hate fear remorse and more the young priest takes his own approach to breaking down the misery of this town

the movie asks some deep questions about the work this priest is doing can it be legitimate he takes confessionbut can he provide absolution he provides words of wisdom or comfort on the pulpit but what does it mean when the town becomes wiser and takes comfort how are we the viewer supposed to feel about all this the town needs healing no doubt if hes bringing it can it be wrong but if hes found out what will that cause

the movie also explores the faith of this very flawed young man i found it to be one of the most rewarding looks at how faith can work in the soul of a troubled person how it heals and how it sometimes fails to heal and how faith can give you some answers but certainly not all i found some of the broad themes similar to what ethan hawkes minister grapples with in first reformed but corpus christi in my opinion cuts deeper and asks far more challenging questions in a more entertaining way

the film is entertaining hugely so to me i felt drawn in by the story and characters and by wondering how it would all end up you grow to care about many of the characters and even though you see that it cannot possible end wellyou yearn for a hollywood ending

the ending of the film moves from the realm of worldly drama to become allegory the final scenes are tough to watch and even a little difficult to understand certainly youll leave the theater or hit the stop button with lots to talk about its intellectually stimulating very human and emotional and star bartosz bielenia is riveting when the religious fervor strikes him i am reminded i almost feel sinful saying it of maria falconetti in the startling silent film the passion of joan its a great performance that elevates this film from really good to nearly great

im not trying to be condescending here but this film is not for casual viewing its not a oh well theres nothing else on kind of thing go in with your mind open and your heart ready to be challenged to think about how the movie makes you feel and why its not an experience i need every day when i watch moviesbut boy when im ready to engage at this level corpus christi really fits the bill highly recommended"
8,Corpus Christi (Boze cialo),98,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/corpus_christi_2020/reviews?type=user,this is an easytograsp morality tale about forgiveness and the need to give others a second chance the photography is suffused with green the color of hope maybe to try to trick the audience but try as he does there is no hope for the main character unfortunately
9,Corpus Christi (Boze cialo),98,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/corpus_christi_2020/reviews?type=user,a harrowing final few minutes combined with a brilliant final act left me numb  corpus christi a polish film is certainly not an elite film and by academy standards its one of the weakest to be nominated in the foreign language department until you start to think  this is a cerebral movie  if youre into it you should be thinking about it long after the credits roll  if intentions are sublime what else matters to the catholic church a lot  final score  7710

4,On the Record,99,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/on_the_record/reviews?type=user,"this doc touches on poc women affected by sexual assault in a way that other films havent for me  as a white woman  this film dives more deeply into the complex intermingled social contracts between men and women and more specifically between men and women within minority populations in the us 

aside from the primary focus on sexual assault power and race  i was deeply touched by the conversations about what we lose as a society when talented women disappear i think drews story and her early successes help us feel the deep implications and loss around this question 

at on point drew talks about her pain she says her pain and her creativity lived in the same compartment of her coping mechanism  this description of how these traumas live inside and alter the course of a persons life is extremely impactful in how we should think about the effects our actions have on others and society"

8,On the Record,99,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/on_the_record/reviews?type=user,"oh god just the opening of this was the same old tired narrative that we have seen way too many times i almost turned it off after 5 minutes because i knew where it was going i have way too much to say but none of it would pass the moderator muster

i didnt even know what this was going to be about i literally thought it was going be about actually vinylcd history with the vinyl poster

plus so much of what was being said was just inaccurate either from trying to romanticize their past or unromanticize or they just have poor memories regarding the historical aspect of the 90s etc

regarding the sexual allegations i mean they just didnt make any sense the first one he harassed her but she kept working with him over and over again what happened to strong women saying no is she saying her career and earnings were more important to keep than walking away from being harassed this sounds more like a regret story than i was trying to get away but got forced into something story too many gaps in what she is telling us it was just the most bizarre story i have ever heard

just to recap she left the bar without him trying to get away from hi but somehow ended up in front of his apartment where he grabbed her and asked her to go upstairs even though she wanted to get away from him she agreed once upstairs she goes into the bedroom you know the bedroom because why not after being harassed by him over and over again and not wanting him near her then of course he does what all men do come into the bedroom fully naked with a rubber on slams her on the bed and once she sees the handcuffs on the wall she gets scared and passes out yup you know how it goes

guess what next she is in the bathtub with him naked well leave out all the details in between of what actually happened and how she got into the bathtub with him after all those are just minor details then she tells him she is leaving and she walks home 22 blocks even though she can grab a cab

she gets home and actually takes a cold shower with all her clothes on because that is what we do but she kept working there and even sat on his lap you know thats what rapists do they beg their victim to keep working there and offer them more money why did they go to the media and not the cops dont get me started on this

if you want to believe that 10 story with 90 missing you go ahead there was zero evidence to back her up except her hollow story

the second story one was a 5 second description literally from then on the stories just seem to get worse and worse they literally seemed to be making up their stories as they went along

it must be sad to look at life through race and gender smh they selective only picked

over all too much minutia and nonsensical details to fill up a documentary who cares about the album she put together

you can see they had practically no one in this documentary that was from the time it was just a few nobodies that should tell you a lot about the legitimacy this could have been a 30 minute segment on youtube feminist gibberish overly broad allegations and trying to make connections between things that dont have any evidence to be connected like the clarence thomas and lynching it was pretty outrageous how far these women are willing to go its ironic because the very thing they claim to fight like collectivism they actually use as evidence for their own claims

you can easily skip thisso predictable"

0,Slay the Dragon,100,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/slay_the_dragon/reviews?type=user,i like that it covers the topic of gerrymandering and draws connections to how gerrymandering leads to the implementation of unpopular policies like righttowork laws at the same time i think it would have benefitted from covering the success of nonpartisan commissions in places like california i also would have liked to see them take on gerrymandering done in blue states like new york look at a congressional district map in nyc and you will see what i am talking about

5,Slay the Dragon,100,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/slay_the_dragon/reviews?type=user,this documentary is an eye opener on gerrymandering particularly the republican concerted effort in 2010 that resulted in highly skewed un democratic voting districts that essentially disenfranchised mostly minority populations that tend to vote democratic the film details the coordinated gerrymandering effort and its deleterious effect on fair election results it enraged me to see this major voter disenfranchisement and inspires me to do more to take back our system of democracy and to enact fair maps
6,Slay the Dragon,100,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/slay_the_dragon/reviews?type=user,inspirational story of what ordinary citizens can do to protect our democracy  and a somber reminder of what happens if we do nothing

8,Slay the Dragon,100,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/slay_the_dragon/reviews?type=user,it feels more like a propaganda piece than a balance documentary they use a lot of obscure anecdotes to prove their point the concept of gerrymandering needs to be abolished so states like california does remain a one party state for perpetuity

however i felt like it desperately needed editing  i found myself saying wait who  larry  werent we talking about howard  whos stewart again whats the timeline here  why am i seeing this piece of footage again  are we doing a reverb on this byte to show that people might have known but chose to walk away or is it some other message im supposed to be inferring  the vital question of who abused howard was brought up and then dropped maybe it was eventually answered and i just didnt get that far

1,House of Hummingbird (Beolsae),100,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/house_of_hummingbird/reviews?type=user,made it about 50 through and gave up maybe the ending had something that warranted these exceptional reviews
2,House of Hummingbird (Beolsae),100,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/house_of_hummingbird/reviews?type=user,beautifully done but so hard to watch its so sad the scenes are so exquisite but i would not recommend to someone who is depressed
3,House of Hummingbird (Beolsae),100,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/house_of_hummingbird/reviews?type=user,"june 26 2020

is there a more tumultuous or uncertain time in our lives than the eighth grade i personally remember this year being particularly difficult one that was probably crucial as far as being formative but nevertheless painful to endure and my experience was hardly unique for one need only consider the plethora of stories across all entire entertainment landscapes as evidence of just how universally traumatic and indelible this period of our lives can be several tv shows the wonder years and hollywood movies not least 2018s aptly titled eighth grade often depict this time with painstaking accuracy when theyre done well they can serve as comforting reminders we werent alone in our prepubescent struggles 

given all the mainstream examples out there we might think the concept of eighth grade woes is exclusive to americans but the latest addition to this evergrowing list is bora kims heartrending house of hummingbird which debuted in its native south korea in 2018 and has just found its way into virtual cinemas in the united states this is fortunate for us because house is a treasure of a film one that kim has crafted with the utmost care and balance her deeply personal screenplay which draws on her own experiences growing up in seoul brings a lot of rich and complicated matters to the table so much in fact there were times when i thought the story might be taking on more that it could handle but kim shows shes in complete control of her resources and exhibits the right amount restraint so that any character or plot development stays within the films own reality and any scenes that perhaps do feel melodramatic can be justified as metaphors for the protagonists stormy feelings and dubious interpretations of her situations which will be relatable to anyone whos ever been 13 or 14yearsold

jihu park plays eunhee our sympathetic eighth grader and her performance is so raw and nuanced that we get a sense of eunhees vulnerability fear and insecurity in the very first shot she is lost confused angry lethargic playful and sad all at once and its her frustration with not knowing which emotion is the right one to have or display at any given moment that puts her on edge shes cautious and selfconscious about everything she says and does and we feel for her because weve all been there for eighth graders one false move in any area of life can be a recipe for disaster

but for all the tension brewing within eunhees mind and body she remains quiet withdrawn and distant because like most eighth graders she doesnt feel theres anyone to whom she can really express herself she certainly cant rely on her family which includes an irritable and often screaming father ingi jung a chronically depressed and docile mother seungyeon lee a physically abusive brother sangyeon son and a philandering sister sooyeon park eunhee is the youngest and routinely feels like an outcast among this dysfunctional clan shes all but a mute around the people who are supposed to love and support her the most 

eunhee and her family live in one of those cramped highrise apartment buildings that are now so common in cities like seoul its a carbon copy of several hundred others next to it and a short distance from the parents store which generates enough income but even so there exists a coldness and despondency inside their home each family member fulfills more a business role than a familial one and it appears as though mom dad brother and sisters are just going through the motions of what their lowermiddleclass society expects of them devoid of any collective laughter or enthusiasm they only ever seem to be joyful when theyre alone and assume no one else is watching

school doesnt provide eunhee much of a sanctuary either she has a friend named jisuk seoyoon park but she like eunhee is caught up in her own world and attempting to reconcile the abusive issues she too faces at home eunhee also has a boyfriend but their relationship is mostly cute and superficial stuck in an endless loop of smiling and giving each other mixtapes plus eunhee isnt even sure she likes boys she has a range of desires and despite not knowing which ones to act on shes smart enough to know which are true

on top of her emotional and relationship troubles eunhee notices a lump on the right side of her face the diagnosis of which isnt good however whats worse than the potential physical side effects of such a lump are the prospective social ones for eunhee is of the age when any change to a young persons physical appearance feels at least to them like a matter of life or death

based on what ive told you you might be thinking house of hummingbird lays on eunhees problems a little thick but kim approaches each of her young heros dilemmas with directness and honesty none is too grand or farfetched and in fact its our being able to see them as possible even typical that allows us to make a connection with eunhee we feel like weve been her at some point in our lives including the moment when she finally lets it all out like so many scenes in the film kim waits until the time is right in the context of the story for eunhee to react to how shes feeling and not necessarily when the audience craves vindication 

kims understated downtoearth strategy makes us believe the events of house of hummingbird are happening in our world and not within the confines of a screenplay her direction with the actors and zoe sua chos meticulous editing particularly her choices of when to show certain scenes and how long to hold on each shot before cutting away give the film a flowing inclusive quality we feel like were living the narrative instead of simply watching it unfold as eunhee seeks hope and recognition through all her turmoil were right there with her

even though house of hummingbird is clearly a serious drama its not all somber and melancholy there are many uplifting and hopeful moments too which speak to kims knowledge that coming of age is a series both ups and downs one of the ups is eunhees exploration of her sexuality with a fellow female classmate named yuri haein seol they share a tender exchange behind a closed curtain in the hospital a scene that comes across so naturally i wonder if kim even had her young actresses rehearse or just improvise

the films best and most memorable scenes however involve eunhees relationship with an adult the angelic ms kim saebyuk kim shes eunhees chinese language instructor whos on temporary leave from seoul university through carefully framed closeups and reaction shots in their tightknit classroom and a limited use of sound kim subtly reveals eunhees slow infatuation with and trust in her teacher its obvious ms kim inspires eunhee for all the usual reasons a teacher inspires a student but ms kim is even more special because this the first time in eunhees early adolescence when someone has taken the time to respect and listen to her they develop a touching friendship and kim interweaves their bonding through and across several other developments so that whenever the story does come back around to ms kim her gentle smooth face is like a breath of fresh air to both eunhee and us decisions like these confirm kim knows what shes doing storytellingwise and they allow the film to really send home ms kims sage advice to eunhee that the world can be beautiful often when we least expect and need it to be the most

i should mention house of hummingbird takes place in 1994 which is important to know because kim deliberately wanted to show a girl coming of age in a south korea that was also coming of age it was during this time the country was entering a period of technological modernity and economic expansion which as we see in the film had farreaching effects on everyone on all rungs of the socioeconomic ladder it recounts two particularly major historical events that are sure to be imprinted onto eunhees memory

but as significant as the historical era is eunhees journey ultimately feels timeless which illustrates the films power as a universal human story the best coming of age tales of which house of hummingbird can now be included are those that shed a fresh light on our understanding of who we are and how far weve come in this case the focus is on that awkward transition from childhood to adolescence which we all know can be one of the most urgent times in our lives kim captures it pointedly and unaffectedly she renders drama simply by relaying truth which makes house one of the more moving and effective films of recent memory and just like our memories of eighth grade itll stay with us for the long haul"

6,House of Hummingbird (Beolsae),100,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/house_of_hummingbird/reviews?type=user,a lot of critics are being myopic if not outright hypocritical about their reviews apparently depending on where the film comes from and whether their whitewest privileged guilt kicks in or not to bash katie says goodbye  which granted isnt so good as being nearly 90 minutes of terrible things happening to the protagonist or saying the lead character is so utterly guileless and innocent and kindhearted  shes essentially a smiley face with a kick me sign taped to her back while heaping nothing but praise on house of hummingbird is absurd bs hoh is just as relentlessly miserable as katie but its even more troubling and a friggin bummer so that makes it that much better thats its more depressing and worse to the lead both are movies with the same issues that couldve been much better imo

3,Possessor: Uncut,93,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/possessor_uncut/reviews?type=user,definitely nuanced and trippy this is good scifi complex rigorous exploration of thought provoking themes re what is the self relationship between consciousness and identity leading virtual lives evil and the mindstate of the evildoer   and ultimately a good takeaway message if you do evil evil will befall you  the evildoer paradoxically needs nonevilhumannormalcy in their own life but that does not make the evildoer less evil and ultimately doing evil overshadows and leads to the destruction of their humanity  however fair warning  there will be bloodhorrifying gore

8,Possessor: Uncut,93,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/possessor_uncut/reviews?type=user,this was so dumb lol some cool parts but its too artsy for its own good like one of those overly complicated black mirror episodes that dont really amount to anything by the way do not watch this movie with your mother
9,Possessor: Uncut,93,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/possessor_uncut/reviews?type=user,yes it is gory and trust me the gore is very realistic but if that is what constitutes as a good film then i can link you to many real gore videos from the deep web that i have personally seen  this is nothing but a gore fetish masquerading itself as an artsy nouveau horror

0,Coup 53,100,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/coup_53/reviews?type=user,"a brilliant movie about a very sensitive subject

as a long time researcher about the 1953 coup i didnt expect to be surprised at all but this movie brought up so much testimony and archival evidence that it belongs in a whole different category of documentary i was reminded of the revolution will not be televised 2003 the depth of description of the crucial months and years leading up during and after the coup is really remarkable i learned tons

i really cant say enough about this movie if you have the chance watch it"
1,Coup 53,100,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/coup_53/reviews?type=user,what a timely reminder of the perils of meddling especially with a cynical mercenary and racist intent  the pace and tension of this film build beautifully no small feat when you consider the reams and reams of paperbased detective work that lie at its heart
2,Coup 53,100,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/coup_53/reviews?type=user,an absolutely essential watch superbly done highly recommend this movie to those who want to understand a great part of the true underlying reasons for the belligerent dynamics of the world today
3,Coup 53,100,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/coup_53/reviews?type=user,an exceptional documentary made based on official sensitive documents that mr amirani had permission to access you will see how he accessed every information he used to make this thrilling documentary an art work that illuminates on dark sections of history which are crucial for global peace
4,Coup 53,100,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/coup_53/reviews?type=user,gripping stuff really enjoyed it what are we the baddies

0,The Painter and the Thief,97,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_painter_and_the_thief/reviews?type=user,left me still thinkimg about the movie hours afterwards and googling the artist and her thief
1,The Painter and the Thief,97,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_painter_and_the_thief/reviews?type=user,a great documentary about 2 people i ended up really caring about warm and heartfelt  the film maker was completely invisiblemade me wonder at times what was setup  rehearsed and what was naturally occuring in the end i didnt care too much about the process i was so involved with the unfolding human drama these are complex lives captured without judgement i loved it
2,The Painter and the Thief,97,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_painter_and_the_thief/reviews?type=user,film is about real people  a painter and the thief that stole her paintings and the way she dealt with him with compassion
3,The Painter and the Thief,97,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_painter_and_the_thief/reviews?type=user,i didnt realise this film was a documentary till the credits came up at the end  blimey it took four years to shoot apart from that it was a brilliant film the best script writer in the world could not have done better great camera workand great personalitiesforget the word acting as this was a true story unfolding infront of a camera
4,The Painter and the Thief,97,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_painter_and_the_thief/reviews?type=user,the movie is well worth watching her subject choice however
5,The Painter and the Thief,97,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_painter_and_the_thief/reviews?type=user,"barbora kysilkova is a better person than i am well she has a capacity for empathy and compassion that is perhaps a bit too difficult for me to get to as easily as she apparently can this is a remarkable work not merely as a great film but also for its display of the fortitude and resiliency of the human spirit and the capacity to see the worth in those who seem like lost causes but who are not by seeing that innate potential for value in others who are selfdestructive or otherwise may appear as little more than vagrants addicts bums we can help those same people rise from the ruins as bertil does here that can also have very real healing empowering potential for those like barbora as well 
benjamin ree has made an extremely interesting visually and psychologically arresting film exceptional camera work as well check this out 4 stars"
6,The Painter and the Thief,97,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_painter_and_the_thief/reviews?type=user,this weekend thanks to ida international documentary association i was given the opportunity to watch norwegian filmmaker benjamin rees documentary the painter and the thief the film follows the 3 year journey of czech artist living in norway barbora kysilkova and her attempt to locate several of her paintings stolen from an art gallery barbora connects at the trial with caught ringleader karlbertil nordland a career criminal fighting a heroin addiction and a possiblyfeigned memory loss of the theft and offers to paint his selfportrait in  hopes this may help her find out the whereabouts of the stolen paintings what follows this initial meeting between the two is an unexpected friendship and empathetic bond over the next 3 years without giving anything away the documentarys ending is rather extraordinary

0,Mystify: Michael Hutchence,100,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/mystify_michael_hutchence/reviews?type=user,lives are a series of what ifsbrain trauma so sad be thankful to those who go before us
1,Mystify: Michael Hutchence,100,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/mystify_michael_hutchence/reviews?type=user,a sensitive portrait of an international superstar lovingly put together by someone who knew him well  put aside the sensational press and get the real story
2,Mystify: Michael Hutchence,100,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/mystify_michael_hutchence/reviews?type=user,gives a very intimate and wonderful driven insight of the man the once myth forever legend
3,Mystify: Michael Hutchence,100,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/mystify_michael_hutchence/reviews?type=user,i dont think most aussies knew what was going on even as we watched inxs from the start
4,Mystify: Michael Hutchence,100,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/mystify_michael_hutchence/reviews?type=user,i found michael hutchens to be pretty dumb and superficial he spent a huge amount of time adjusting his hair do and smoking i think inxs success has a lot more to do with andrew ferris songwriting than anything michael hutchens did his voice was very good but very one dimensional there was very little range in it sort of like mick jagger in the movie bono talks about what a great singer hutchens was but in fact bono is an infinitely better singer than hutchens primarily to do with his range and ability to alter his styles hutchens biggest contribution to rock and roll was his looks and that never bodes well for a performers legacy
5,Mystify: Michael Hutchence,100,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/mystify_michael_hutchence/reviews?type=user,excelente trabajo de recuperar grabaciones de la vida intima de hutchence
6,Mystify: Michael Hutchence,100,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/mystify_michael_hutchence/reviews?type=user,a film that doesnt quite provide the insight into its subject that it would like to and one which has little use for the music other than as a soundtrack despite all the interviews with  it feels like  just about everybody around him the real depths of his personality and his art seem frustratingly out of reach
7,Mystify: Michael Hutchence,100,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/mystify_michael_hutchence/reviews?type=user,i thought i knew a lot about michael i was wrong such a tragic waste of a beautiful soul appreciated the insight from those closest to him and the band loved all the old footage and stories and of course the music his voice one that i will never listen to without going back to this piece the great thing about it is that you dont have to be a superfan to have it resonate but you just might be after you see it continues after credits
8,Mystify: Michael Hutchence,100,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/mystify_michael_hutchence/reviews?type=user,i really loved the archival footage and portrayal of michaels character via people who grew up with him and knew him hes definitely missed
9,Mystify: Michael Hutchence,100,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/mystify_michael_hutchence/reviews?type=user,i didnt like anything i loved everything i seriously could have sat there four or five hours just eating up all things michael watching all video footage of michael he was such a poignant figure in my musical life and he died the day after my father so itll definitely be a day ill never ever be able to forget  i was in college when mtv began and was sitting in front of a television the second it came on air  i had to have watched this time at least 250 times it is my 1 inxs song and i couldnt get enough of seeing that video i loved michael i had no idea he struggled with the issues he did he always seemed so confident on stage
0,The Half of It,97,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_half_of_it/reviews?type=user,this film was pretty ok the plot was a good spin on the whole love triangle trope thats been done to death i loved the main actress and thought everyone was pretty good i wish the characters were a bit more interesting though i feel like they really missed chances to dive into their backgrounds fully the ending was kinda messy felt a little too rushed and somehow both over and under written like the dialogue and metaphors were a little much and felt too try hard to be deep but overall i liked the cast the story the pacing if only the characters script and the cinematography was a bit better
1,The Half of It,97,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_half_of_it/reviews?type=user,im gay but this movie made me homophobic
2,The Half of It,97,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_half_of_it/reviews?type=user,i wrote a really long review but it got deleted i may end up writing it again but for now ill shorten it ellie seemed to be closed off and opens up but her friends seemingly abandon her and she has no reaction white boy is annoying throughout and i hated him and his development wasnt great imo aster seems confused but never shows it more than i dont know what to do ill do this and it doesnt come up again i see many good aspects but i cant truly enjoy it because i cant relate to the characters
3,The Half of It,97,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_half_of_it/reviews?type=user,sweet and heartwarming
4,The Half of It,97,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_half_of_it/reviews?type=user,"so beautiful
the characters were so complex and beyond their years"
5,The Half of It,97,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_half_of_it/reviews?type=user,while it doesnt add a lot that is new to the teen romance type of film the half of it has enough good things going for it to raise it above the level of the competition  filled with witty and insightful dialogue from fully developed likable characters the movie offers up a slew of little insights about human nature unrequited love and the difficulty of trying to fit in when you feel like an outsider  as outlandish as some of the situations are the church scene near the end for example a direct ripoff from the graduate they are somehow believable thanks in part to solid performances from the young cast
6,The Half of It,97,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_half_of_it/reviews?type=user,kind of different as a gay movie several cultural dots and layers get tangled up in a warm and heartfelt way
7,The Half of It,97,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_half_of_it/reviews?type=user,despite some quite hollywoodian moments this is a very intelligent movie with a moving story and characters we really get to care about especially paul and ellie
8,The Half of It,97,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_half_of_it/reviews?type=user,although there was a lot of familiar territory at times as in movie tropes the movie was charming enough to let that slip thanks largely in part to the stellar cast loved the writing and the style of this film which made me smile choke up and laugh out loud at times i would have loved to have seen this movie made for a more mature audience however rather than pg13

0,Relic,91,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/relic_2020/reviews?type=user,original well acted excellent audio had me scared and jumping throughout recommended
1,Relic,91,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/relic_2020/reviews?type=user,relic is a movie that does two things well it builds up a sense of dread successfully and piques your interest with its mystery i felt that these two elements were done well and i found myself interested throughout the emotional ending and its message was a shock to me  i had not seen it coming i wish that whether or not there were supernatural elements of the film would have been more clear throughout the movie i also would have liked more insight into the backstory as the grandmother seemed to have an awkward relationship with her daughter but that was never delved into in any case i found this to be a great movie and a great horror with a worthwhile and deep message about an issue that many families deal with
2,Relic,91,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/relic_2020/reviews?type=user,atmospheric chilling and well acted by its all female cast some of the cinematography was disorientating and i wasnt always quite sure which world i was in but this was perhaps done purposefully and to effect
3,Relic,91,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/relic_2020/reviews?type=user,natalie erika james with her virgin feature the relic which didnt scare me or entertain  the story here is metaphorical and if youre not in the mood for that youre gonna hate it  the tonal changes are frustrating and james doesnt earn them  really solid performances that are boosted by the music telling you to be scared  by the third act youll understand the premise of losing your mind  i enjoyed the unanswered questions more than i liked the answers and that ending  i get it i just didnt like it  lots of metaphors  final score 510
4,Relic,91,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/relic_2020/reviews?type=user,expected so much kept waiting for the threads to come together and at the end it petered out into weird scene with no link between most of the scenes throughout very strange very disappointing
5,Relic,91,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/relic_2020/reviews?type=user,"relic is an australian horror drama film about mother and daughter kay and sam travels to their remote family home and neighborhood when edna an elderly and matriarch of their family goes missing it is upon ednas mysterious return that the creepy and horrific circumstances start to happen in their family house that the three lead women need to resolve before it starts to take over their lives 
relic has a very atmospheric thriller horror it extensively uses the tension atmosphere to create and deliver the horror it wants the moviegoers to see feel and hear there is no grand use of special effects nor much jump scare tropes to create a horror for relic but it heavily relies on atmosphere of dread shadoweddark settings and tension to deliver this even the simple conversations were effective to create the creepiness it wants to deliver lead actresses emily mortimer robyn nevin and bella heathcotes trio of chemistry as family were effective convincing and stellar in their acting performances the films story was intriguing to watch wellwritten and executed well but i just wish that the film further elaborates or explains the phenomena that happens in the family i think with a little more explanation especially by the ending would have make a more statement for relic"

7,Relic,91,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/relic_2020/reviews?type=user,it was stupid im honestly upset i sat thought the entire movie hoping it would get better
8,Relic,91,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/relic_2020/reviews?type=user,we did not enjoy it expected a horror movie and was disappointed
9,Relic,91,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/relic_2020/reviews?type=user,"aunque pausada en ritmo relic tiene una extraña energía que me mantuvo pegado a la silla mientras la veía

su trio interpretativo es más que solvente y su historia va in crescendo con la tensión que en los minutos finales esta manejada de forma perfecta

me encantan las lecturas que personalmente he sacado yo de la cinta pero sí es cierto que el final me ha dejado un poco confundido por otro lado algunos la encontrarán pretenciosa no les culpo

9,Babyteeth,94,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/babyteeth/reviews?type=user,the moments of stillness were powerful the scenes where something dramatic happens were unconvincing in the writing and acting and seemed at odds with the characters behaviour at other times good performances by the young leads and ben mendelshon i dont mind having gaps in explaining everything in a movie but there were a few odd plot points the pregnant neighbour what was the deal with her  the psychiatristfather and how did she manage to afford that house on her own i found the progress of the daughters illness wasnt reflected in her physical appearance or behaviour a decent aussie movie a bit like a grown up episode of neighbours or home  away and im surprised its getting such overwhelming praise

0,Boys State,94,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/boys_state/reviews?type=user,interesting insightful moves at a good pace really superb piece of documentary film making
1,Boys State,94,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/boys_state/reviews?type=user,a striking if unsettling looking at american politics boiled down to the microcosm of texas boys state the documentary is hard to watch at times if only because it highlights the flaws and blemishes in our current political system country and citizens perhaps not a surprise that my biggest takeaway from this modern lord of the flies is that whoever yells the loudest usually wins
2,Boys State,94,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/boys_state/reviews?type=user,a staggering portrait of todays political climate through the eyes of todays youth boys state serves as both a reflection and contemplation of where we are today as a nation and where we want to go
3,Boys State,94,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/boys_state/reviews?type=user,uno de los documentales mas movidos que he visto entretenido muy explicado para que se pueda entender que es lo que esta ocurriendo e incluso a la vez tenso por las guerras de palabras que se forman en los debates y elecciones es un documental inspirador y fenomenal
4,Boys State,94,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/boys_state/reviews?type=user,ive never seen so many sad nerds in my life
5,Boys State,94,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/boys_state/reviews?type=user,these boys are at turns impressive and terrifying
6,Boys State,94,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/boys_state/reviews?type=user,the american people will always and will be the power of the world years of advantage carry all of humanity doing a school of politics to train your youth is on another level standing ovation
7,Boys State,94,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/boys_state/reviews?type=user,eyeopening and fascinating
8,Boys State,94,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/boys_state/reviews?type=user,boys state is a compelling enthralling documentary that serves as a deep look into the american political system each year the american legion invites high school juniors 17yos to compete in mock government elections to learn more about the american political system this has been occuring since 1937 this film focuses on the texas boys there are girls events too event held last year in austin for 7 days about 1000 boys are selected and go through a mock campaign of devising political strategies and campaigning for various government roles with governor being the highest office the boys are split into two parties nationalist and federalist the film follows four boys in particular during this process one of them is steven garza of mexican heritage who leans liberal the others are definitely more conservative in nature understandable in a state like texas the film is a microcosm of the political system which is both fascinating and scary young testosterone is flowing freely through out as the boys combat each other sadly abortion and gun rights seem to be the two main issues rather than issues like health and education the film has a remarkable energy and it is quite gripping in its telling as we build to the climax its very easy to be totally enthralled by the events taking place they say the youth are our future and after watching this film this had me feeling both sad and hopeful in the same thought
9,Boys State,94,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/boys_state/reviews?type=user,upsetting at times but mostly a fascinating look at teenagers and politics
0,Circus of Books,98,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/circus_of_books/reviews?type=user,this is a great documentary about an adult bookstore in los angeles if those walls could talk
1,Circus of Books,98,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/circus_of_books/reviews?type=user,so much more than youd expect worth every minute
2,Circus of Books,98,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/circus_of_books/reviews?type=user,fun to watch especially if you are of an age to remember the gay community b4 being out was much harder than today
3,Circus of Books,98,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/circus_of_books/reviews?type=user,just wish it was longer and got deep in some stories but great overall
4,Circus of Books,98,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/circus_of_books/reviews?type=user,fascinating look into an interesting family and their business
5,Circus of Books,98,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/circus_of_books/reviews?type=user,its hard to review this without spoiling it though the poster might give it away as the surprising subject matter is definitely part of the fun for me as an audience so i will be brief for a change this netflix documentary by rachel mason is primarily about her jewish parents who run a bookstore in los angeles in the 1970s working with a limited budget i imagine the result is akin a more professionally done family video but it also means this is an intimate and cosy affair and watching this on a small screen wont affect its enjoyment at all the film acts both as a lovely paean to her parents as well as a visual historical document on the fight and preservation of free speech in the usa during the same time period via people who are personally affected or involved in that fight between those objectives the latter is almost a byproduct of this sweet and passionate film that is brimming with love for a pair of unsung heroes two unassuming individuals whose lives took an unexpected turn when they took over the titular bookshop and then has to balance family values with the risqué business they found themselves engaged in there are no deep revelatory insights here just anecdotal perhaps even superficial information and stories youll glean out of their struggles but it is tremendous fun and extremely real and you will be so charmed by these genuinely fascinating people that you will find those 90 minutes spent with them well worth your time
6,Circus of Books,98,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/circus_of_books/reviews?type=user,"circus of books is an excellent movie which tells you the whole story of how the family got started in the adult book store industry and how they kept quiet about it so that there friends and relatives including their religious clergy where they worship did not know about it

the movie was written by rachel mason the bookstores owner and did it in excellent taste

i more than highly recommend this movie which you can see on netflicks

thank you

sincerely yours

la documentalista rachel robson hija de ambos filmó este interesante documental sobre sus padres figuras centrales de la película y este negocio con una gran material gráfico varios reportajes y una muy buena articulación de las dimensiones familiar social política jurídica y económica del porno y lo gay que incluye una monumental ironía que aquí no revelaré

afortunadamente estamos ante un documental que salta el cerco de lo autorreferencial y no ante uno de tantos ensayos autobiográficos narcisistas que sólo interesan a sus realizadorxs"
8,Circus of Books,98,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/circus_of_books/reviews?type=user,a fantastic funny moving and thought provoking documentary about how a middle class jewish couple ended up running a gay adult book store and became the biggest distributors of gay pornography in the usa this really is a mustsee film
9,Circus of Books,98,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/circus_of_books/reviews?type=user,la historia de los esposos karen y barry mason y sus tres hijos es increíble más allá del negocio que manejaban la historia de esta familia es grandiosa y la directora rachel hija de la pareja hace un trabajo fenomenal documentado la vida de su familia
0,La Llorona,97,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/la_llorona_2019/reviews?type=user,la llorona is not a horror story that will satisfy fans of gore or jump scares  instead this is a methodical ghost story summoned from a unique sociopolitical backdrop of guatemalan genocide  bustamante does away with plotting in favor of building a thick air tension and dread  the film is deliberately static with the general and his family cloistered in their mansion  yet the pipes tambours and chanting of protestors outside build an eerie and stressful backdrop for the house  in la llorona the violence lies under the surface and lurks in the past but slowly it begins to trickle into the present
1,La Llorona,97,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/la_llorona_2019/reviews?type=user,la obra de jayro bustamente no decepciona en absoluto bebiendo de la influencia de otros grandes autores latinoamericanos como cuarón o iñarritu bustamente fusiona la ya clásica leyenda con elementos de terror tan reales como lo son la dictadura y la opresión social en una historia desgarradora e intensa
2,La Llorona,97,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/la_llorona_2019/reviews?type=user,if youre into slow burns this movies for you although the movie was wellmade and had an interested story not much happened it was too slowpaced kinda boring and lacked any real scares felt like this film was incomplete
3,La Llorona,97,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/la_llorona_2019/reviews?type=user,after reading a bunch of reviews i was pretty stoked to see this i actually enjoyed the concept centered around this older gentlemenor scum of the earth being a war criminal the idea that the protesters seemed like they were outside their palatial estate 247 was intriguing to me i thought the film was shot beautifully as well thats really all i liked about this movie this film wasnt even the least bit scary ive seen goosebumps episodes scarier than this wait let me rephrase that every episode of goosebumps ever made was scarier than this was this really considered a horror movie yes committing genocide is a horror in itself i understand all that but this movie falls short in delivering any scary moments yes some people will say finally a horror movie without jump scares and crappy cgi i know i had a few too many alcoholic beverages during this movie but did we even get to see la lloronathe ghost even one freaking time oh wait what am i complaining about we did get to hear her cries in the background this movie is a slow burn that never stops burning slow the ending is laughable you wont be able to see my  face when you read this review but if you listen closely you will hear my cries in the background
4,La Llorona,97,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/la_llorona_2019/reviews?type=user,a perfect horror film it never gets lost in its history and its incredible
5,La Llorona,97,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/la_llorona_2019/reviews?type=user,billed as a horror applauded as politically and historically relevant it has been very well received its writing lacks any real substance and depth to what should be a really emotive theme the suspense falls short too which really doesnt help the slowburn pace in which it is directed such a shame it fails to deliver as this could have been incredible it ends up being a beautiful example of cinematographic mastery as nicolás wong effortlessly glides from opulence and elegance to a dim and claustrophobic hell having seen it i get that the horror is pinned as an adjunct to the history as opposed to being the lens through which the story is told again this isnt easy to accept with such flaws in the films delivery so it just feels feeble
6,La Llorona,97,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/la_llorona_2019/reviews?type=user,this is a decent and well made drama worth watching for that aspect but theres hardly any horror aspect in the film so skip it if thats what youre after
7,La Llorona,97,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/la_llorona_2019/reviews?type=user,it needs more corn 
8,La Llorona,97,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/la_llorona_2019/reviews?type=user,im not familiar with the lore so the movie doesnt really resonate with me it just felt like a long draggy drama with an unsatisfying payoff
9,La Llorona,97,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/la_llorona_2019/reviews?type=user,pretty slow and predictable the actors seem not well trained perhaps have no experience wouldnt recommend a boring movie like this one
0,Anything for Jackson,98,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/anything_for_jackson/reviews?type=user,messy and borderline comedic anything for jackson is the product of considering what would happen when two grieving grandparents turn to the devil to cope with loss and grief the darkcomedy is laced with the horrors of grieving deceased loved ones and turning to cultbehavior in the wake of an inability to cope i suggest anything for jackson to althorror lovers of movies like honeymoon 2014 looking for something that isnt perfectly horror but rather interesting to watch
1,Anything for Jackson,98,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/anything_for_jackson/reviews?type=user,if horror movies were coffee this was a devilishly dark deep delicious contemplation satisfying and very well excited for a low budget itll make you look at your dr a little differently
2,Anything for Jackson,98,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/anything_for_jackson/reviews?type=user,where do i start the movie was bland there was 0 scary parts gave me hereditary vibes characters also bland i honestly do not recommend this movie shows it was made in 2020 the director needs to put his mind into something more concrete this movie was just not it so keep trying buddy the worst 130 ever wasted in my life and the end i know that was a joke hereditary meets 13 ghost
3,Anything for Jackson,98,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/anything_for_jackson/reviews?type=user,una de las sorpresas del año sin duda su propuesta es magnífica y bastante fresca lástima que no sea tan gamberra o tan cómica como podría haber sido pero la dupla de sheila mccarthy y julian rigins es tan genial que se lo dejas pasar muy disfrutable
4,Anything for Jackson,98,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/anything_for_jackson/reviews?type=user,"to be fair ill watch just about anything with julian richings in it but that can be a hit or miss approach

this movie very much a hit it combines a few staples of the horror genre with an atypical pair of characters to create something fairly singular a hard task in an era when so many stories seem overtold add some very talented actors and surprisingly good effects and this movie is really solid worth a rewatch"
5,Anything for Jackson,98,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/anything_for_jackson/reviews?type=user,best horror movie of 2020 goes to anything for jacskson in my book an old couple kidnaps a pregnant woman to summon their lost grandson to the baby  sounds simple enough but it goes deeper into the occult and everything else goes haywire and weirder its starts as a dark comedy but eventually gets serious  every scene is amusing and scary no dull moments the character build up and story is fluid  feels like the new insidious of this generation
6,Anything for Jackson,98,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/anything_for_jackson/reviews?type=user,delicately muddying the waters between villain and victim entitlement and desperation anything for jackson cleverly explores the dark recesses of grief and its dangerous potential  while you may come to the film for the ghosts and demonic possessions youll stay for two of the most endearingly villainous characters in modern horror
7,Anything for Jackson,98,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/anything_for_jackson/reviews?type=user,poignant and hilarious commentary on loss
8,Anything for Jackson,98,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/anything_for_jackson/reviews?type=user,honestly i only made it 24 minutes into the movie and i must say it scared me i pretty much was unable to finish the movie ill probably go back and watch but not by myself
9,Anything for Jackson,98,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/anything_for_jackson/reviews?type=user,this wasnt bad at all actually i really enjoyed how they opened the movie  how they filmed that kitchen scene was fantastic its only downfall is since you know the plot up front theres really not much surprise after not that there really would be anyway since thats how all movies of this nature play out but maybe that was why they did it that way in the first place its not a bad watch though
0,Vitalina Varela,98,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/vitalina_varela/reviews?type=user,although the movies emotional power is hollowed out by its dreadfully slow pacing that will put mainstream viewers off for those who love sumptuous photography this movie offers several dozen of the most purely captivating images of the year as a study in the use of chiaroscuro and the use of tableaux to tell a story and as a study in the opposite of the conventional wisdom of movies being purely for escapism i can recommend this to viewers wishing to broaden their understanding of what a movie can be and how can be told
1,Vitalina Varela,98,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/vitalina_varela/reviews?type=user,there arent many words in vitalina varela  this is a forgettable feature  heres what ya do smoke three bowls then you can become a critic and talk about how artsy it is  its a bore but its fun to look at  its a film that just lies there and if its your cup of tea then good for you  it isnt mine and i dare you to tell me what it was about without looking up a summary  exactly  final score  1810
2,Vitalina Varela,98,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/vitalina_varela/reviews?type=user,the story didnt do anything for me but holy cow this movie is absolutely stunning visually unlike anything ive ever seen before must see
3,Vitalina Varela,98,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/vitalina_varela/reviews?type=user,this movie is horrible
4,Vitalina Varela,98,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/vitalina_varela/reviews?type=user,exquisite atmospheric cinematography and lighting aside this otherwise excessively tedious exercise in pregnant pauses long lingering shots of insignificance pretentious monologues and voluminous footage of mundane activities that adds nothing to the narrative makes one glad for the fast forward button fewer films have i seen that make the viewer long for the ending  and when it finally comes its largely unsatisfying likely to evoke a huge so what i fail to understand the critics raves about this one but with such a dearth of new material out there at the moment i imagine that almost anything will do to satisfy the appetites of the hungry
0,Spontaneous,98,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/spontaneous/reviews?type=user,too quirky for its own good and not realistic enough for its extremely traumatic events not as good as i thought it would be honestly
1,Spontaneous,98,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/spontaneous/reviews?type=user,favorite film from 2020 i wouldve loved to see this in theaters but at home was great too its a romcomdramahorror all in one and it perfectly juggles everything
2,Spontaneous,98,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/spontaneous/reviews?type=user,amazing fresh great movie good cast
3,Spontaneous,98,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/spontaneous/reviews?type=user,"dont understand how this film has such a high rating it could be such an original and really good film if they explained what and why it happened but it makes absolutely no sense
quick review no spoilers
everyone explodes he was a boy she was a girl obvious guess what more exploding everyone is on pills  and then  boom the film ends without explanation
the worst part is that they make you think the exploding is happening because of one thing i cant say because of spoilers and then you find out that you were wrong but they dont explain it at all

if youre looking for a good movie for passive watching when youre doing your homework  well"
4,Spontaneous,98,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/spontaneous/reviews?type=user,i watched it because it received good critics big mistake nowadays and it was really disappointing a total nonsense at the end it has just a few scenes that made me laugh but overall it was pretty boring for me i wasted of time
5,Spontaneous,98,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/spontaneous/reviews?type=user,spontaneous is a dark and delightful drama comedy that hits all the right spots teen dramas can always tread the same path so its sometimes hard to do something original but this film does it very well set in a small american town mara and dylan are senior high school schoolmates one day a fellow student explodes yes that is right explodes its dark and scary but no one knows the reason dylan has a crush on mara and soon she responds in kind their blossoming relationship is kind and full of joy its very convincing and this is due to great performances from the leads in charlie plummer and katherine langford both are likeable and charming as the story progresses more and more students explode leading to the senior class being placed in quarantine it makes for great entertainment that is both smart and funny
6,Spontaneous,98,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/spontaneous/reviews?type=user,i didnt find this film all that funny as the metaphor of spontaneously exploding was clearly meant to mimic the realworld traumas of violence and mental health issues that teens face there is nothing funny about that if anything this film was incredibly sad and kind of boring and the message a little too obvious this is an overrated film with good acting a teen film clearly not meant for generation z but rather aimed at adults who have a fondness for the 80s
7,Spontaneous,98,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/spontaneous/reviews?type=user,audacious in its immensely original premise and actually quite profound in its inspirational ending spontaneous is just a different beast altogether in the realm of comingofage flicks although its tone is expectedly all over the place the humor is mostly strong the central performance from katherine langford is terrific and the film is both touching and surprisingly exceedingly romantic its the type of wildly authentic movie that should be given to those people who are skeptics with regards to the existence of originality in todays films
8,Spontaneous,98,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/spontaneous/reviews?type=user,pretty good sad towards the end movie starring the new up and comer charlie plummer and the girl from 13 reasons why this is a different type of rom com than what im used to and im glad this movie was made this isnt your ordinary rom com its much darker than you would think i was definitely surprised this movie took the risks that it did this movie did not have a happy ending and that makes me sad but thats life sometimes not everything can be a perfect hollywood ending and i respect this movie for doing that the performances from the two main people are fantastic charlie plummer is really growing on me and i believe that he is the new micheal cera he has the same quirkiness but a 2020 version its great now the reason why im giving this movie only a 35 is because it can disappoint a lot of people the last act is pretty depressing and again i respect that but i wanted a somewhat nice ending anyway besides that this is a strong movie i highly recommend this but not if you get depressed easily because man that ending shook me up
9,Spontaneous,98,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/spontaneous/reviews?type=user,pretty good sad towards the end movie starring the new up and comer charlie plummer and the girl from 13 reasons why this is a different type of rom com than what im used to and im glad this movie was made this isnt your ordinary rom com its much darker than you would think i was definitely surprised this movie took the risks that it did this movie did not have a happy ending and that makes me sad but thats life sometimes not everything can be a perfect hollywood ending and i respect this movie for doing that the performances from the two main people are fantastic charlie plummer is really growing on me and i believe that he is the new micheal cera he has the same quirkiness but a 2020 version its great now the reason why im giving this movie only a 35 is because it can disappoint a lot of people the last act is pretty depressing and again i respect that but i wanted a somewhat nice ending anyway besides that this is a strong movie i highly recommend this but not if you get depressed easily because man that ending shook me up 
0,Rocks,98,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/rocks/reviews?type=user,maybe its because watching a bunch of teenager girls talk over each other isnt normally my idea of entertainment ive steered clear of this critically wellreceived film that has landed in manys top 10 list last year however im glad to have caught up on it now on netflix and the girls overlapping dialogue turns out not as disagreeable as i had initially anticipated storywise this reminds me of the better capernaum though hackney cant compare with beirut in terms of exoticness helene louvarts cinematography makes a good stab in capturing the councilchic side of london sholarocks is a nigerianjamaican schoolgirl whose single mother has decided to take an indefinite break leaving behind a note a few quid and a younger brother for her to take care of but this is less about how she copes and dodges social services as its about the bond within the sisterhood of her close schoolmates a melting pot of different cultural backgrounds and shades of skin colours directed by sarah gavron whose last film the starstudded suffragette is the complete opposite of this her indiespirited collaboration with writers theresa ikoko and claire wilson and a cast of young and freshfaced firsttimers benefits from their naturalism and the clichefree loachian approach theyve adapted which never panders or patronises performances from bukky bakray and dangelou osei kissiedu as the abandoned siblings are cheeky heartbreaking and entirely convincing without being oversaccahrine or irksome even when they are making mistakes that youre desperately willing them not to admittedly the film took a while for me to get into but it ends up being surprisingly engaging and even though i still dont consider a bunch of teenage girls giggling and gabbing my idea of cinematic fun next time ill try to be more openminded about it
1,Rocks,98,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/rocks/reviews?type=user,a very real fresh account of hardship being overcome by a teenage girl with the support of her tightknit friendship group bakrays and alis characters relationship is strong and the actresses performances really make that an effortless display the whole thing feels very real and raw the emotions are inline with the age group and the situations as well as some of the carnage that ensues whilst a serious and sometimes harrowing account of what life can be like for some of our youth it also provides some comedy and moments to make you smile really well done by the powerhouse of young ladies who deliver this so brilliantly
2,Rocks,98,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/rocks/reviews?type=user,dysfunctional family no father mother leaves cute boy looked after by sister feral schoolchildren hardpressed teachers no future no prospects its been done so many many times and done so much better
3,Rocks,98,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/rocks/reviews?type=user,words cannot convey the raw emotion and absolute realism of this film  the teenage lead and her brother perform with acting masterclass that belies their age and experience  nothing about this feels forced or contrived as we see the joyful lives of teenage girls and the issues many in the social care system suffer through daily  despite its subject matter the film manages to inspire hope for the future if we can just hold on   a must watch
4,Rocks,98,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/rocks/reviews?type=user,this is the first phenomenal british film ive seen in a while the child actors are brilliant in this it made me cry smile and laugh  i recommend everyone of all ages to watch this
5,Rocks,98,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/rocks/reviews?type=user,i thought this film was awesome i loved its portrayal of teen girls rocks was a great character and superb performance and her little brothers performance broke my heart  it was a bitter sweet film which depicted teen female relationships in a positive light in a way that they so rarely are im going to recommend it to all the teenagers i know

1,Disclosure,98,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/disclosure_2020_2/reviews?type=user,absolutely amazing this really helped me understand trans people and their beauty also thoroughly addressed how entertainment formed so many biases among society against transness especially trans women i was able to confront so many unconscious biases ive had im going to go watch the amazing mentioned movies with actual trans representation
2,Disclosure,98,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/disclosure_2020_2/reviews?type=user,inspiring moving and indicative of the harsh realities trans people face mostly focused on male to female stories in film and tv i wouldve liked to have seen more female to male representation but still a fantastic documentary and enlightening even more those wellversed in queer and trans issues

1,"Why Don't You Just Die! (Papa, sdokhni)",97,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/why_dont_you_just_die/reviews?type=user,brutal and brutally funny this film is a russian sam rami tarantinoesque blood fest with an interesting twisty story that may be predictable at times but getting to the punch line makes this watch worth it
2,"Why Don't You Just Die! (Papa, sdokhni)",97,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/why_dont_you_just_die/reviews?type=user,александр кузнецов aleksandr kuznetsov is the new heartbeat of world cinema enchanting even in the midst of some of the most ridiculously entertaining ultraviolence ever filmed kirill sokolovs directing debut threatens to dethrone quentin tarantino while simultaneously honoring his legacy this is a dark comedy that delivers abundant laughter emerging from gasps of disbelief its by far the cleverest movie ive seen in years
3,"Why Don't You Just Die! (Papa, sdokhni)",97,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/why_dont_you_just_die/reviews?type=user,opening with young boyish looking matvei arriving at his girlfriend olyas parents home with a hammer behind his back writerdirector kirill sokolovs ultraviolent ultrastylised tarantino meets looney tunes russian thriller sucks you right in with an intriguing premise that just keeps getting wilder and more demented out in its home country in 2019 and arriving now on discs and streaming on the arrow channel this is essentially a morality tale wrapped in a bloodsoaked mystery where truths and motivations are slowly revealed over the course of the films 96mins duration as matvei battles olyas family and particularly andrey whos perfectly cast as her potentially abusive andor bad cop father who has his own secret to hide the loud and intrusive score is a fun eclectic mix of western russian and eurodance which frankly i dont mind once i buy into the playful less than serious everythingandthekitchensink tone of the film the relentless and ingeniously choreographed fight scenes are stylishly staged often in beautiful slomo in direct juxtaposition to the cartoonish violence thats accompanied by comedic and exaggerated sound effects the result is a genre piece presented in a fearlessly inyourface manner where you are both grossed out and entertained at the same time by what you see on screen the story set practically entirely within the apartment save for a few flashbacks for backstories using primary colour schemes that will soon turn mostly red adopts a clever and engaging narrative device with a fractured timeline that keep its audience guessing and expecting the humour is devilishly wicked the violence is cartoonish and senseless and the film is a kinetic rush of energy that simply would not let up until its inevitably grand guignol ending in short great escapist fun for those into this sort of thing
4,"Why Don't You Just Die! (Papa, sdokhni)",97,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/why_dont_you_just_die/reviews?type=user,great escapism when we need it here half way through 2020 reminiscent of a tarantino film tight editing of all aspects  visual and sound entertaining source music deadpan acting and absurd violence a a movie lovers movie highly recommended
5,"Why Don't You Just Die! (Papa, sdokhni)",97,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/why_dont_you_just_die/reviews?type=user,the best russian film ive ever seen also possibly the only russian film ive ever seen like a sloppy tarantino on heavy medication although way too heavily stylized in places its a lot of fun

0,The Swerve,98,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_swerve/reviews?type=user,this movie is very well written topnotch acting brutal emotionally and hard to watch but you just cant take your eyes off the screen
1,The Swerve,98,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_swerve/reviews?type=user,there are two swerves in the swerve but youd have to be not watching to see the second one coming  theres a lot of good here for a film mostly spinning its wheels  dean kapsalis shows hes got an idea for his feature debut  hes got a pair of shorts to his credit and this would have been better served sliced down  azura skye is marvelous  shes worth the watch  somebody give her something juicy  while her character is mostly one note shes tremendous  why do people run at a gun   why is there nobody at the supermarket like ever  i get it extras cost money but holy moly i want to shop there  this needs to be a lot tighter and crisp  we have a some fantastic acting here but again it tells the same story a couple times before we get to the obvious conclusion  final score 510
2,The Swerve,98,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_swerve/reviews?type=user,é bom mas tem de tomar cuidado com os gatilhos de sofrimento
3,The Swerve,98,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_swerve/reviews?type=user,unforgettable movie that charts the internal implosion of a woman spiralling into madness after two decades and dozens of acting credits under her belt azura skye gets the juiciest role of her career to date and absolutely nails it i was gripped from beginning to end inside the clutches of her characters psychosis one of the 2020s hidden gems
4,The Swerve,98,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_swerve/reviews?type=user,dark and wellacted but ultimately the film falls short of anything close to insight or catharsis  let alone entertainment
5,The Swerve,98,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_swerve/reviews?type=user,pretty astonishing that this is a debut feature tense and gripping with amazingly assured direction and a stellar lead performance
6,The Swerve,98,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_swerve/reviews?type=user,i rented this because of the reviews bad mistake as this movie is trash slow and a couple of peaks doesnt make a movie dont waste your time
7,The Swerve,98,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_swerve/reviews?type=user,a very dark psychologicaldramacharacter study of mental illness that involves a small town school teacher who becomes completely undone the direction writing and music are top notch and the lead actress is incredible youre with her the entire time and the last 20 minutes left me breathless the whole film is brilliant very disturbing and incredibly done
8,The Swerve,98,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_swerve/reviews?type=user,the swerve is easily one of the best films ive seen in the last three years i had heard some of the hype but wasnt expecting it to be as stunning as it is is it a horror film yes and i daresay scarier than a lot of other movies that share the genre the difference for me is how deeply felt it is how surgically precise in finding so much horror in the daily existence of the central character its a horror story in the way macbeth is and thats not a stretch shakespeare references are in the production design and in the most terrifying pie ive seen since titus andronicus most of the credit belongs to director and writer dean kapsalis of course but he couldnt have pulled this off without azura skyes oscarworthy performance and the rest of the amazing supporting cast and crew i cant wait to see what he does next
9,The Swerve,98,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_swerve/reviews?type=user,azura skye is hauntingly devastating as a mother pushed to her ultimate brink of guilt sorrow and depression to literally fall from the face of the earth by everyone around her probably one of the scariest movies you will get to see this year 
0,Saint Maud,97,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/saint_maud/reviews?type=user,a24 has done it again not surprisingly of course although dont go into this expecting an abundance of horroryou must be patient for much of the film you cant seem to figure out whether some of what is happening is actually happening or simply the lead characters own hallucinations although the director essentially clears that up with a 1second clip at the very end wonderfully written acted directed and shot saint maud will not be for those folks who need a steady stream of jump scare tactics this isnt that sort of film and it is all the better for it
1,Saint Maud,97,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/saint_maud/reviews?type=user,dawg this was intense
2,Saint Maud,97,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/saint_maud/reviews?type=user,i hated it nothing happened boring as hell no link between scenes no storyline nothing
3,Saint Maud,97,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/saint_maud/reviews?type=user,"my little saviour

last movie i watched in cinemas before it closed again bloody corona anywhere

saint maud is a new horror movie from a24 that was unfortunately advertise as something else

new horror film
a24
praised by critics
hated by audiences

i think we all know the routine by now i am aware that film is subjective am just pointing out a familiar pattern

while i wouldnt say i was scared by saint maud but it really did unnerve me to the point it felt kind of overwhelming it builds up on the sinking dread rather than the next scare so dont just write this off as a simple horror movie because its so much more than that you could easily view this whole movie as a character study on maud the loneliness girl in the world the fact that this is rose glass feature debut is more surreal than the movie itself

for whatever reason this reminded me of brian de palmas 1976 film carrie both movies are drama heavy character studies with a female lead which so happen to be labelled as horror and not forgetting the religious undertones throughout both films and the psychical effects it can have on you a wild comparison so let me leave it there

this is a female driven movie while all the men are a bunch of one note jackasses used only for sex with this being a horror movie it was a nice reverse in tropes

morfydd clark delivers an excellent performance as maud shifting between a wide range of emotions such as delight hopeless and pain clark really made me feel sorry for the character jennifer ehle who is the type of actor that would always appear in everything and would often been mistaken for meryl streep also delivers a great supporting performance

the setting of the movie taking place in englands north sea coast of scarborough where everything looks so damp cold and unkind despite all that the cinematography from ben fordesman made use of the lighting by making the whole thing visually appealing not only in colours but lights and shadows

the frightening score by adam janota bzowski made the tense scenes feel incredibly claustrophobic than it already was sometimes the music will play in sync with the scene thanks to the great editing

religion plays a principal theme in the movie and relies heavily on psychological horror muad herself is extremely religious to a point it becomes unhealthy and alienating to her god is everywhere he is around us and if youve been a good little saint you might feel him move inside of you or maybe if you pray hard enough he will finally speak to you but what will he sound like if its your own voice that you can hear does that destroy years of dedication worshiping a biblical character is religion another form of mental illness some many questions that will never get a straightforward answer thats life though dont think about it too much because it will drive you nuts

the last frame of this movie was the most haunting thing i have seen this year and it was only 1 second of frame

overall rating thank god for morfydd clark and rose glass"
4,Saint Maud,97,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/saint_maud/reviews?type=user,great performances from the leads deliciously modern and an amazing ending
5,Saint Maud,97,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/saint_maud/reviews?type=user,"yawn

a nasty pretentious gratuitously sick little film that didnt tell you anything about cultish religion descent into madness or what its like to face imminent death whatever it claimed to do 

if you like student show reels trying to shock and throwing in every cliche in the book of the dark movie genre youll love this film"
6,Saint Maud,97,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/saint_maud/reviews?type=user,thoughtful psychological horror film with great performances
7,Saint Maud,97,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/saint_maud/reviews?type=user,a horror masterpiece since the exorcist
8,Saint Maud,97,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/saint_maud/reviews?type=user,writerdirector rose glass debut feature is a disturbing and intense psychothriller with a sapphic slant that dares to reimagine bergmans persona with norma desmond and nurse ratched in a creepy old house in some english coastal town except just for fun andor copyright reasons this desmond is a exdancer getting palliative care from a young and uberreligious ratched with a saviour complex who talks to god in welsh strong in visuals and atmosphere glass demonstrates an abundance in skills and confidence as well as a keen eye for talent in her casting morfydd clark as the titular character a mysterious and lonely young woman haunted by some terrible incident before which was only hinted at as she spirals deeper into a psychosis that threatens herself and those around her including her patient and the object of her obsession jennifer ehles amanda who can flip any mood and emotion 180 degrees at a drop of a beret if this is horror which i have reservations in labelling as such this is more akin to the shining its about ones unholy decent mentally speaking into something horrifying and the screenplay is aware and playful with genre and expectations especially with the scenes involving lily knights excolleague joy which kept me on the edge of my seat glass screenplay understands the inevitability of where all this is heading and has the conviction not to cop out from an unbearably unpleasant ending that the film has been setting itself up for from the first minute if not for the great reviews this is not the type of film id normally go see but im glad i saw this incredibly assured debut which should serve very well for both director and star as a calling card for future projects
9,Saint Maud,97,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/saint_maud/reviews?type=user,saint maud is a triumph of modern horror and a true masterpiece what i just witnessed is an hour and a half of pure terror from beginning to end the colour grading is disgusting the camera angles are nauseating and the both the diegetic and nondiegetic sound are overbearing to the point that you get a headache but it is all done to make the audience feel uncomfortable and unsettled because that is when you feel the most afraid i applaud rose glass for taking a risk making a movie that will not connect with the general public but what is one of the best horrors of all time morfydd clark is a force to be reckoned with pulling in a utterly fantastic performance as the main character as for the rest of the cast they all performed absolutely wonderfully with performances that are so inventively creative overall saint maud is an utterly unique and memorable movie which deserves to be remembered as one of the greatest horrors of all time
0,The Go-Go's,98,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_go_gos/reviews?type=user,actually better than the band served as a great tour of the late 70s early 80s la punk and indi scene
1,The Go-Go's,98,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_go_gos/reviews?type=user,excellent
2,The Go-Go's,98,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_go_gos/reviews?type=user,this movie is a great story of not only the origins and formation of one of the greatest rock and roll bands of all time but also a great story of friendships and sisterhood and the bonds friends make and how through adversity that bond is always there
3,The Go-Go's,98,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_go_gos/reviews?type=user,great doc about the early days until their original breakup of this band i want to see more the movie ends at 1984 fun footage and excellent interviews
4,The Go-Go's,98,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_go_gos/reviews?type=user,"the gogos  i had a great interest in seeing this documentary film because i am and was a dedicated fan since the 1980s the beginning of the gogos career  full disclosure i was a huge gogos fan  so no surprise that i watched the premiere of the documentary on the day it was released july 31 2020  since then i have seen the film 4 times  i rated this documentary high for the following reasons
1  i felt like the director brought in authentic truthful comments from the people portrayed in the film mainly the artists that worked with the gogos and the gogos themselves  there was no reallife but scripted feeling at all
2  the documentarys background history of the gogos was something new and fresh that i had never known before as a young fan and i found it fascinating that i really didnt know a lot about the gogos  who they were their talents their story  and where they came from
3  i saw so much in this documentary that would be familiar to a genuine fan but i also saw new photos newsclippings and video that i had never seen before

when the documentary was over my immediate reaction was i  felt like it was too short and i wanted more it also made me happy and i knew i would watch it again"
5,The Go-Go's,98,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_go_gos/reviews?type=user,a favorite documentary of the year i love the gogos and their story but i love this telling of it there is great humor and care and love in all of it i look forward to watching it again
6,The Go-Go's,98,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_go_gos/reviews?type=user,i was never a big fan back in the day but i wasnt a hater either i liked some of their tunes what i found appealing about this doc was the humble yet brutal honesty not just about their rr lifestyle fame or breakup which had the usual traps but their honesty that the sanctity of music wasnt the driving force behind their formation that it was the punkska scene they just wanted to be a part of and music was but a means to an end one of them says basically we sucked but we didnt care nobody did it was punk we just plugged in and played and whatever happened happened not exactly a prince or buddy holly perfectionist respect the craft mindset but its who they were and they didnt deny it it wasnt until they added a few key pieces that the musicianship work ethic and quality elevatedwhich ultimately paid off i also respect their pioneer legacy and the guts it took to make some of the uncomfortable decisions  changes they had to make to become what they did its not if i leave here tomorrow but its still a good music doc definitely recommended
7,The Go-Go's,98,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_go_gos/reviews?type=user,i was never huge go gos fan simply enjoyed their ugly pop songs this documentary has given me a much better appreciation for their music the women behind that music their achievements and struggles i was moved
8,The Go-Go's,98,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_go_gos/reviews?type=user,i have it now in my dvr ive watched it about 10 times already its one of the best filmsdocs ive ever watched i fell in love all over again as much as i am not a fan of the rrhof lately thank god the cars finally got in the gogos must be inducted   they made history and we love them for it  their music is authentic and wild and great  lets go go go 
9,The Go-Go's,98,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_go_gos/reviews?type=user,colorbynumbers rock doc sure i get the allgirl band factor they were trail blazers the story matters but in retrospect the gogos catalog was thin if you are a student of rock n roll like me youll like this
0,Fourteen,98,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/fourteen_2019/reviews?type=user,soft spoken and understated fourteen is also way too self aware and it becomes distracting  theres no doubt writer editor and director dan sallitt is trying to tell us something  he has a character even say im more conversational now  there is also the mention of budgets and i just found it all too inside baseball for a film that seemed like it was a really bad special episode of a movie about nothing  this is a slice of life and very real but as a stand alone 94 minute feature no thanks  another in the long line of shorts stretched and i do mean stretched to feature length with lots of scenery but a story that isnt pushed forward  and despite it being a quiet indy you have to be very in touch with every little detail which is supposed to draw you in but instead frustrated me  normally i like these films but salitt is so unable to take a stand on mental illness instead letting this slop sit there  its a shame the filmmaker doesnt get it right because the acting here from an entirely unknown cast is mostly outstanding  they arent given much to work with but they do a marvelous job  the final plot twist which i could see from my porch ties in the relationship between our two leads tallie medel and norma kuhling  this duo need better agents  i want to see them again perhaps even together  get it done  long periods of time often go by from one scene to the next without explanation and i kinda liked it  its something that grew on me but its also distracting  your hand is definitely not held but then well have two to three minutes of silence  the plot sits  final score  410

4,Fourteen,98,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/fourteen_2019/reviews?type=user,"reviews of 14 that i have read speak of amity they seem to distort the movies disequilibrium it really centers on the experience of one character mara and the flaws in her attempts to be there for a goesbackalong way friend being there for her school buddy is a tenacious project for mara a role delivered with wholesome innocence by tallie medel the notion that the movie is about friends is a distortion although mara had an alliance in the past with the other main character jo norma kuhling and kept in touch the movie primarily concerns just one side of this connection the narrative is about incompatibilities how the raw material of a child an unsullied clay plastic with the potential to meld is in the grownup world rigid formed into a strange and inconsonant shape choices priorities experience are at playand chemicals both the bodys hormones and particularly in jos case  a relentless topup of abusive substances 
the movie opens with the two women their synchronicity already unmeshed jo is the loose cannon to maras stoic timekeeping and loyal attachments two brooklyn lives lived between polarities of selfloathing and care for others are they typical is this a microcosm certainly the movie is one of those new york dramas that report on life and relationships in the city with forensic attention to chat chatups schedules and places to park the problem in jo and maras relationship is that it totally lacks privacy it is staged in diners bars and social events when taken home it is in moments of crisis the movies settings are a snapshot of zeitgeist interior décors institutional and domestic as well as the anodyne environments of new york hospitality this society is fixated on an individuals choices one choice is the freedom to fuck up mara is no saint she lacks the compassion empathy imagination and generosity to be genuinely supportive and it frustrates the hell out of her the denouement is the equivalent of a secular confession mother to child or the older persons letter to her younger self childhood is a time of unconditional trust adults lose faith in one another seeking to exist on their own terms maras primary aim is to define her independence by constructing a safe space keeping a distance from others it isnt a buddy movie it is a travesty of compassion enacted as an internal dialogue"

7,The Last Tree,98,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_last_tree/reviews?type=user,love the writing and execution of this film i was engaged from beginning to end
8,The Last Tree,98,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_last_tree/reviews?type=user,enyoyable but  not nearly as good as some of the later mcu films would become
9,The Last Tree,98,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_last_tree/reviews?type=user,while this coming of age tale tries valiantly to make a meaningful statement its underdeveloped narrative and unresolved story threads keep it from reaching its potential greatness the films impressive performances especially by lead sam adewunmi superb cinematography and complementary score mesh well together but its unfortunate that the underlying script doesnt make use of them to best advantage with nods to moonlight and other productions director shola amoo does a capable job of telling the protagonists story but he just cant quite pull them all together especially in the final act still the filmmaker in his sophomore feature offering is someone to watch in future releases especially if he hones his writing to match the quality of the images he displays on screen
0,Fireball: Visitors from Darker Worlds,98,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/fireball_visitors_from_darker_worlds/reviews?type=user,good stuff herzog is always so enthusiastic
1,Fireball: Visitors from Darker Worlds,98,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/fireball_visitors_from_darker_worlds/reviews?type=user,im not sure why people have rated this poorly this was a beautiful piece of film full of interesting landscapes quirky reallife people and just enough editing and sound to creat a sense of wonderment that is difficult to find these days ive already watched it twice
2,Fireball: Visitors from Darker Worlds,98,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/fireball_visitors_from_darker_worlds/reviews?type=user,the content was disjointed and often irrelevant with personal commentary of the director who is often racist and culturally insensitive to the peoples and places they travel to
0,Another Round (Druk),93,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/another_round/reviews?type=user,great to see regular men depicted as multidimensional
1,Another Round (Druk),93,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/another_round/reviews?type=user,can a film realistically straddle the fence of a controversial subject without getting its hands dirty despite the risk of angering proponents on each side of that controversy thats what danish director thomas vinterbergs latest offering seeks to do for the topic of drinking one that brings with it alleged benefits and potential harm as well as a boatload of sensitive cultural connotations this edgy comedydrama about four friends who conduct a dubious experiment about the supposed creative professional and social merits that can come from intentional sustained alcohol consumption traverses thorny questions of responsibility selfcontrol and personal balance and how their handling can either work to our advantage or against our wellbeing needless to say this is a tricky narrative path to follow but the filmmaker manages to navigate through it rather skillfully even if the final product is too unrealistically tidy at times with a closing sequence thats a little too long and arguably unresolved this offering is sure to provoke strong responses either way but no one is likely to come away from it without having a welldefined opinion
2,Another Round (Druk),93,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/another_round/reviews?type=user,gran película el elenco es magnifico real y conmovedora
3,Another Round (Druk),93,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/another_round/reviews?type=user,sorry but does not work like that you cant put a good director and an excellent actor and just pretend is a good film do reviewers watch this stuff this is a comedy drama that doesnt make you smile nor sad in other words this is a boring movie with a very basic story
4,Another Round (Druk),93,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/another_round/reviews?type=user,another round is tonally inconsistent with the comedic elements being silly and quite problematic in intentions but the dramatic elements undoubtedly worked especially the movies depiction of the male midlife crisis the direction from vinterberg is strong and some scenes here are quite impactful the highlight of the film is definitely mads mikkelsen whose performance here is one of the best of the year
5,Another Round (Druk),93,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/another_round/reviews?type=user,being that im a die hard mads fan i guess i felt it was good but could have been much better i think his talent was underused in this film but the dance sequence at the end made up for it kind of depressing though with alcoholism all or nothing i am 30 years sober and when youre life is unmanageable as his was its time to quit
6,Another Round (Druk),93,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/another_round/reviews?type=user,da unidea veramente creativa si parte con una sorta di commedia seria che oltre a far sorridere porta una morale davvero interessante soprattutto viste le modalità con cui ci viene trasmessa non cè niente fuori posto tutto funziona con coerenza senza intoppi laspetto che forse lascia più il segno è proprio lidea cardine di tutto il film che sfocia in quello che forse è il finale più bello dellanno nel complesso davvero un film interessante uno di quelli che in un deserto cinematografico riesce ancora a proporre qualcosa di innovativo
7,Another Round (Druk),93,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/another_round/reviews?type=user,wow now i see why so many people were saying so good about that film thomas vintenberg does here the best film of his career since the hunt what an experience mads mikkelsen is really fantastic perfect a dramatic story about the alcohol mixing smoothly with comedy if you want to see a great story with great actors a great direction and with ahh a simply extraordinary final ending then you have here a mustsee masterpiece 55

9,Another Round (Druk),93,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/another_round/reviews?type=user,"four friends all high school teachers test a theory that they will improve their lives by maintaining a constant level of alcohol in their blood source imdb

im glad that i had the chance to enjoy watching another round at home and thats thanks to the toronto international film festival

after his unforgettable performance in the hunt mads mikkelsen gives us another great performance as he plays martin in another round if i would choose which one is his best performance i would choose the hunt for sure and thats because of the emotional and deep feelings that character had and mads mikkelsen was able to express that perfectly in another round his character is kind of similar to the one in the hunt but the difference is that in the hunt his character was battling a difficult time of his life as he gave up on it and doesnt have anything left to lose he was desperate but in another round its kind of the opposite he is trying to improve his life by maintaining a constant level of alcohol in his blood hoping itll work and mads mikkelsen was brilliant in that sometimes by just looking into his eyes you can feel whats inside of him grief  happiness  loneliness  sadness and etc
the supporting cast was was brilliant his other 3 friends were all great in their performances when they wanted us to laugh we did laugh and when they wanted us to get emotional we did indeed get emotional perfect casting

for those who dont know both the hunt and another round are directed by thomas vinterberg and thats why you might notice that the movie is a bit smilier to th hunt with the set design the characters and the message of the film for example the scene where the 4 friends went to the supermarket when they were drunk kind of reminded me of the one in the hunt when he went inside the supermarket and got kicked out but in my opinion i prefer another round than the hunt i gave the hunt a 6510 and i was disappointed by it especially that it has so many good reviews and thats why i was worried of watching another round because i felt like it would be the same but i was wrong 
another round had so many conversations that were long but they were so fun not like the hunt all the conversations were boring and cold for example in another round the scene that all of them were having dinner and thats when we started to know the story of the movie and where the movie is taking us the movie started off with happiness and with so much energy but as we were going towards the movie it started to go down little by little and slowly and thats what i loved about it the movie makes you wonder what will happen at the end and what their lives will be in the end and thats a thing that made me want to watch and enjoy the movie the film made us happy and sad and happy and sad again all the time 

the set design was beautiful the camera angles were able to capture the beauty of the set design and thats not a new thing to a thomas vinterberg film and maybe that might be the main reason why this movie remained me of the hunt martins apartment the school and the dinner table with the amazing designs of the cups and glasses 
the custom designs were pretty okay they were matching the environment very well

finally the music was brilliant and a great choice especially that song at the very end when martin was dancing around such a great scene and a nice ending to a nice movie

so glad that i was able to be one of the first people to watch  review another round great movie and highly recommend it

my rating is 810"

yes god yes is a perfect coming of age film the film is absolutely hilarious and really shows what christian teenagers have to go through in puberty and high school times it just feels really authentic the film is set in the early 2000s so there is no social media which couldve been used to spread this false information about the protagonist but that there is no social media just makes it so much better i mean the protagonist doesnt have any idea of what that means that everyone things she has done until the near end of the film natalia dyer is fantastic and her character just is really likeable and that this is karren maines directorial debut makes it even better i hope she has a bright future"
1,"Yes, God, Yes",94,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/yes_god_yes/reviews?type=user,a funny simple but thoughtful coming of age story it takes well aimed jabs at a particular type of pseudomorality the religious policing of what others choose to do with their own bodies it shows the silliness of sexual repression without ever really getting its hands too dirty with what the dark side of that can look like
2,"Yes, God, Yes",94,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/yes_god_yes/reviews?type=user,a great movie that is short and to the point natalia dyer delivers a great job there are a few weak points though so thats why it only gets a 45 star rating from me
3,"Yes, God, Yes",94,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/yes_god_yes/reviews?type=user,a very well done and nicely paced coming of age comedy that doesnt necessarily break any ground in the genre but feels unique in its own right and isnt afraid to be a little controversial natalie dyer does a solid job here and the writing and direction is on point yes god yes tells a grounded story and many will find dyers character to be very likeable and relatable
4,"Yes, God, Yes",94,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/yes_god_yes/reviews?type=user,un film molto semplice che va dritto al punto e racconta in modo spontaneo una piccola fase della vita di una giovane adolescente niente di particolarmente esaltante ma il film riesce appieno a soddisfare le leggere premesse stabilite nei primi venti minuti forse unesperienza troppo rapida ma sicuramente positiva ed apprezzabile
5,"Yes, God, Yes",94,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/yes_god_yes/reviews?type=user,nice coming of age movie about sexual curiosity and religious taboos mixed messages and hypocrites add to the confusion of a young teen girl just trying to figure out what feels good
6,"Yes, God, Yes",94,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/yes_god_yes/reviews?type=user,"a drama added to netflix back in march its a comingofage story where a catholic girl in a strict catholic school learning about sex after an aol chat 

the theme of the movie was that nobody is perfect and even though the end was a little bit preachy the rest before was very real and relatable to many also the movie poked at the ridiculousness of the catholic school where any small things that were considered sin would be reported and it felt pretty good to see the lies underneath all these ridiculousness 

also i love the double meaning behind the title which was pretty clever and fit the movie

overall a relatable drama that delivered its theme well 810"

9,"Yes, God, Yes",94,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/yes_god_yes/reviews?type=user,the latest in a wave of satirical comingofage comedies in recent years with varying degrees of wry wit and more american pieesque humor which i am 100 on board with its like the world collectively decided to lovingly poke fun at john hughes with films like eighth grade booksmart and good boys yes god yes takes on a distinct perspective with the catholic school angle and is genuinely funny but has a flaw in that it remains pretty onenote on the premise for most of the humor and the more sincere undertones dont really resonate as well as they probably should dyer does a great job in the lead role recreating the awkward mannerisms and uncertainty that are pretty much a vital component of the high school experience everyone should have an older wise biker woman to provide sage advice to them in random bars down the road from their christian youth camp 355

0,Bacurau (Nighthawk),92,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/bacurau/reviews?type=user,bacurau is a bizarre genre bending film that has to be seen to be believed the entire cast was very solid the story is consistently interesting it starts off very normal setting up what this town was like but then slowly but surely it takes a turn the film mashes up many genres while still keeping a consistent tone the violence is wonderfully gory and well earned it also has sociopolitical commentary that works very well overall this was great i wanna say as little as i can as possible go in blind and enjoy the insanity

bacurau is considered among the best films of 2020 this film is on spot 9 on my top ten the filmmaking and the production values and acting and all that is amazing but i didnt liked the screenwriting so much at the end of the film i didnt liked one character throughout the film i didnt cared what would happen to those characters and i have to say it this is probably the most unnecessary violent thing ive ever seen"

0,Enola Holmes,90,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/enola_holmes/reviews?type=user,for a youngadolescent focus it does not do as much to maintain the interest of the age ranges the attention to ciphers was pretty charming although it aggravated my husband over the length of the movie i think theres intrigue in a family detective approach given the introduction of a sherlock and that complexities introduced regarding womens suffrage movements go less answered or contextualized than wed expect in most movies more cast wouldve come together in the prioritized highlights the offbeat dynamics of the relationships are challenging to embrace being presented as so profound yet evidently superficial and despite savory scene setting the generational discord of her friends lordship is a fascinating involvement only at the end while his character remains less affecting and convincing

1,John Lewis: Good Trouble,96,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/john_lewis_good_trouble/reviews?type=user,an excellent moving film it gives us the viewers a crystal clear insight into the late rep john lewiss life through interviews with him family friends staff and colleagues its portrayal of lewis shows a man with imperfections but of integrity and strength of character and conviction
2,John Lewis: Good Trouble,96,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/john_lewis_good_trouble/reviews?type=user,this documentary is about the life of john lewis congressman and civil rights icon the film uses interviews many of them with lewis as a much older but still committed fighter for civil rights and archival film and photo sources to tell his story it is a pretty standard documentary there is nothing extraordinary about the filming or the approach however it is an inspiring story about a man who marched with martin luther king jr and found himself arrested and sometimes beaten in his fight for civil rights he became famous for saying that people should get into good trouble there is a lot of very important history here that still has relevance in 21st century america we seem to live in a time when people who protest are considered antiamerican or are otherwise vilified but this is a wonderful call to arms that the fight is not anywhere near being over and that we all need to find ways to get into good trouble and make the change that needs to happen the stage changes but the play seems to remain the same big thumbs up for a powerful story of a man who devoted his life to making change i highly recommend this film
3,John Lewis: Good Trouble,96,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/john_lewis_good_trouble/reviews?type=user,congressman lewis inspired me to get into some good trouble its been 55 years and the right to vote is still under attack today time to make a difference

5,John Lewis: Good Trouble,96,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/john_lewis_good_trouble/reviews?type=user,a biopic of a real american hero  this film puts john lewiss life in context and shows how the struggles of the civil rights era are relevant today and not in the ways that youd think
6,John Lewis: Good Trouble,96,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/john_lewis_good_trouble/reviews?type=user,"there is an old african proverb when you pray you move your feet   the proverb resonates powerfully in this quote from john lewis memoir walking in the wind as a nation if we care for the beloved community we must move our feet our hands our hearts our resources to build and not tear down to reconcile and not to divide to love and not to hate to heal and not to kill  in the final analysis we are one people one family one house the american house the american family 

john lewis is a powerful writer  i read  walking in the wind several years ago and it had a  powerful impact on me  john lewis good trouble the documentary makes that same powerful impact   it brings his story to life  as in his memoir the film reveals the man behind the legend   

i was moved to tears by the footage from the 1960s  i was beginning my teenage years back in 1963 television was still a young medium and it showed us all that was going on in the world daily  i was learning about the world and its ways in the 60sthe injustices the fight for dignity freedom equality and decency  these were my middle school years my high school years formative years brought back to life as i watched this film 

history repeats itself until we learn  john lewis good trouble follows john lewis throughout his young life in alabama working on his parents farm feeding chickens picking cotton  mr lewis narration of waking up early hiding under the porch to wait for the school bus running onto the bus to get to school to his wonderful teachers where he says he read everything is a powerful visual image  i love what one of his sisters says about john wearing a tie and carrying the bible to school every day  john was a serious student  he wanted more in his life  clearly he wanted to make a difference in our country for racial justice for african american people his tireless work and dedication started as a college student from sncc leader to congressman from georgia john lewis fought the good fight for voters rights for civil rights for the right to eat at the same restaurant as white people for integration not segregation  his marches his belief in nonviolence and commitment to the cause have continued for 65 years

one story that henry gates jr tells about john lewis greatgreat grandfather getting his voting card back in the 1800s has a powerful twist so many stories so much history where he worked so hard from the time of dr martin luther king to president barack obama to now 

this inspirational documentary is a must see  john lewis good trouble weaves an important story about an exceptional man shows us our history from the 60s to today and demonstrates the part john lewis played and continues to play as the fight for racial justice and equality is at a pivotal moment in time with the black lives matter movement 

i give john lewis good trouble 5 out of 5 stars and highly recommend it for 9 to 18yearolds to learn about an effective leader and his plightand to understand even further the times we are currently living through i also recommend it to adults to remember all that has transpired through the years to reflect and act on how we can all move forward once and for all to make the change that is way long overdue  reviewed by terry s kids first reviewer kidsfirstmedia"
7,John Lewis: Good Trouble,96,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/john_lewis_good_trouble/reviews?type=user,this is a necessary timely portrait of an american hero who we all should know more about rep lewis has walked the walk for justice and equality for decades as i watched i realized how many intersecting points exist between him and iconic organizations individuals and moments in our nations history sncc freedom rides marching in selma  this man is a national treasure and im happy this film does justice to his remarkable story

9,"A White, White Day (Hvítur, hvítur dagur)",96,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/a_white_white_day/reviews?type=user,a white white day is a film about grief and the process of coming to terms with it its an impressive film that slowly burns through out set in a remote village in iceland the film begins with a car slowly driving through fog before plunging over an enbankment we soon learn the car belonged to the wife of local police officer ingimundur her death sends him into a spiral of grief and rage he suspects there might be foul play and tries to uncover the truth but even though this is central to the film it does not unfold as a thriller but rather as an examination of the grief process we see ingimundur building a house for his daughter visiting a therapist to cope with his grief and most importantly spending time with his beloved granddaughter this is the crux of the film the relationship between them is special and shines a light on their shared past and hopeful future this is a beautifully realised film full of empathy and pathos performances are great especially ingvar eggert sigurosson as the grieving husband the film has strange but beautiful aesthetic choices too making for an unusual but fullfilling drama
0,Borat: Subsequent Moviefilm,85,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/borat_subsequent_moviefilm/reviews?type=user,"this was an absolutely horrible movie  it lacks any type of creativity beyond cohens typical shtick of making fun of poor people who show him generosity  in typical 2020 fashion the political minutiae of the film will have all of the experts drooling while providing next to no comedic value  but cohen really doesnt care about that  thats not what this film is for  

dont waste your time  its trash as is cohen"
1,Borat: Subsequent Moviefilm,85,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/borat_subsequent_moviefilm/reviews?type=user,what happened to borat complete garbage
2,Borat: Subsequent Moviefilm,85,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/borat_subsequent_moviefilm/reviews?type=user,lost his mojo this movie is shadow of first borat movie
3,Borat: Subsequent Moviefilm,85,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/borat_subsequent_moviefilm/reviews?type=user,just like the original this film is very funny great and this one is even more crude than the first actress maria bakalova did a great job as borats daughter a must see
4,Borat: Subsequent Moviefilm,85,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/borat_subsequent_moviefilm/reviews?type=user,the first borat was a masterpiece this one ehh not so much it was trying way too hard the first film had a flow from which the humor came organically this one always looking for a joke always looking to offend it became very heavy after a while
5,Borat: Subsequent Moviefilm,85,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/borat_subsequent_moviefilm/reviews?type=user,it was ok i can see what he sbc was trying to do just too long trying to be shocking but did have some funny bits real shame was rooting for it to be brilliant
6,Borat: Subsequent Moviefilm,85,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/borat_subsequent_moviefilm/reviews?type=user,another level of comedy
7,Borat: Subsequent Moviefilm,85,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/borat_subsequent_moviefilm/reviews?type=user,"hello from russia i love cohens work such a comedian is the only one in the whole world to make fun of people who think that the grotesque country i have invented really exists where gay men wear blue berets women sit in cages everyone drinks horse urine and the age of consent is nine you must be able to do this cohen shows that behind a fake smile and education behind this whole screen are the same uneducated people living in stereotypes which makes them no better than the people who live in this grotesque country of kazakhstan this film really gives people the thought that they need to change works like this film are rare a fan of marvel films will not understand the depth of this film
 warning spoiler i especially liked how kazakhstan sent borat to the gulag and with his help is trying to take revenge on the world this is really funny reflects how kazakhs react to this film
ps i hope cohen will come back to us more than once in a similar manner and bring us many more films it is worth saying that during the filming of the first and second parts cohen was exposed to the fact that he could be shot indeed a person is ready for a lot for the sake of art thank you sasha cohen we love you in russia"
8,Borat: Subsequent Moviefilm,85,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/borat_subsequent_moviefilm/reviews?type=user,this move should be a requirement to see prior to voting  hilarious and real all at once  must watch
9,Borat: Subsequent Moviefilm,85,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/borat_subsequent_moviefilm/reviews?type=user,this works so well as a comedy satire and social commentary we cannot expect this to be as good as the first but as the summary of the end of trump and covid infested year of 2020 this does a perfect job not only is it funny but at times touching sasha baron cohen is famous for making people uncomfortable in all his films he does it here too however borat 2 also manages to have some really touching scenes centering around normal americans and the man himself trying to save himself and his daughter borat creates a hilarious comparison between america in 2020 and kazakhstan he acts fantastically but the real reactions of the victims of his satire take this film to another level
0,Emma.,87,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/emma_2020/reviews?type=user,the movie had only a couple good moments
1,Emma.,87,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/emma_2020/reviews?type=user,i have never ever written a bad review for a movie ive seen but this this deserves 0 stars bad actingworst acting i have ever seen the whole movie is awkward facial expressions are strange its like watching characters rehears for the first time the only actor that is alright is george knightlyonly attractive well played role  emma looks like shes reading her lines harriet sounds like an annoying child out of breath and her acting is awful mr elton is a joke he is just a joke same with mrs bates hate both of em everyone else seems to be making fun of their rolenot taking it seriously its not that timely to the 1800s the only things that are anything like the 1800s are the costumessome look cheaply made though and the outdoor locations the movie directors should have done more research on the time period the music soundtrack seems to have been put together by a 12 year old no actually maybe a 8 year old the music is awful and it cuts in and out at the oddest moments all the characters walk around like waddling ducks its quite painful to watch every single character is strange and their voices are absolutely awful the fashion is alright and that the only thing historically nearly correct in this sorry but rotten tomatoes was wrong about this one i would give this 0 stars if i could its insulting to the novel its like watching 10 years old act out a childs play for the first time
2,Emma.,87,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/emma_2020/reviews?type=user,"saw trailers for this and they must have put all the funny moments into the trailer

the title character of emma woodhouse anya taylorjoy is such a dismal condescending and sometimes arrogant woman who only seems to think that her own opinions are correct

the only and i mean only saving grace of this film are the scenes in which miranda hart features in"
3,Emma.,87,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/emma_2020/reviews?type=user,the sophistication behind jane austins literature remains faithfully graceful upon being adapted to showcase ranging talents rather than generating something engaging besides those who prefer prints over reels since this is a solidly worthwhile addition to their reading list b
4,Emma.,87,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/emma_2020/reviews?type=user,a massive waste of joy
5,Emma.,87,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/emma_2020/reviews?type=user,emma is a strange strange adaptation while the directing will put viewers off at times the strangeness will at other moments make the story more enjoyable as joe wright showed with pride  prejudice you have to find a way to inject originality into a story thats 400 years old if anyones going to enjoy the new edition
6,Emma.,87,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/emma_2020/reviews?type=user,the actress playing emma was not handsome and there was no sign of clever she also has an awful adenoidal voice the saving grace was the outdoor locations with some beautiful huge trees including a chestnut and some cedars
7,Emma.,87,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/emma_2020/reviews?type=user,i didnt finish watching it it was sooo boring and with weirdly unlikable main charactersactors i couldnt make myself to watch more than about 40 minutes
8,Emma.,87,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/emma_2020/reviews?type=user,period piece movies are hit or miss for me emma is one of those movies that just didnt click for me personally but i feel genre fans will love it i think the movie is very colorful and the costume and set design are gorgeous i also think the performances are good and there are some charming moments i just couldnt find myself getting invested in the story or characters but maybe those loyal to this story might think differently overall it is kind of a mixed bag for me because i think the movie is technically good but kind of boring when it comes to the story
9,Emma.,87,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/emma_2020/reviews?type=user,a lovely film well cast beautiful sets and costumes very well acted lightly comedic and entertaining to the eye and spirit

9,The Dissident,96,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_dissident/reviews?type=user,fantastic so in depth would see again in a heartbeat
0,Shithouse,96,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/shithouse/reviews?type=user,surprisingly good look into the inner workings of an anxious college freshman boy and a somewhat less anxious sophomore girl touching with some nice humorous moments but the feelgood happy ending prevented it from being more memorable
1,Shithouse,96,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/shithouse/reviews?type=user,this was a perfect 2020 coming of age rom com for me so blown away by cooper raiff feels like a college kid actually made the movie which made it that much more compelling to watch alex is an emotional character which is soo refreshing to see a young guy who isnt afraid to be vulnerable and isnt driven by sex that is my kinda protagonist absolutely worth the rent i already want to rewatch
2,Shithouse,96,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/shithouse/reviews?type=user,it is easily one of my favorite movies in this year it deserves a lot more attention than it gets i always wanted such a movie and now it exists i like this idea that the main character is not childish well may be a little but rather is raised normal has normal family and normal life the others on the other hand act as they do because they are somewhat damaged i have never seen earlier this idea explored i hope i will see more of such films next year
3,Shithouse,96,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/shithouse/reviews?type=user,i call absolute bs on this certified rating  cmonnn guys get it together 22 the ratings made me so excited for this movie for so long  for some reason i get a strong vibe that the director is exactly like this in real life 
4,Shithouse,96,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/shithouse/reviews?type=user,this is one of the better of its kind to come out in a while the structure is very simple but its a formula that really works well the fairly well known story brand is made great by some strong performances by the largely unknown cast which i always personally appreciate and the climax and ending are both satisfying if you are looking for a funny light drama this is one to catch
5,Shithouse,96,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/shithouse/reviews?type=user,wife walked out about 25mins into the movie  i hate watched to end  sadly  main character is the worst  most punchable person
6,Shithouse,96,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/shithouse/reviews?type=user,it was really an pleasant experiencethere were deep conversations in the moviemust watch for every first year college studentsthats all
7,Shithouse,96,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/shithouse/reviews?type=user,"a fresh coming of age movie great writing great acting great story i laughed i cried i shared it on facebook because i want everyone to see it my movie criteria has four stages
see it in a theater
wait to rent
wait for cable
pass it up
shithouse is a see it in a theater but luckily you can rent it now and pass on getting covid19 yay  loved it"
8,Shithouse,96,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/shithouse/reviews?type=user,that was a really good movie im actually impressed by this guy cooper raiff who wrote directed produced and acted in the movie solid dialogues and a lot of feels i recommend to watch this movie
9,Shithouse,96,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/shithouse/reviews?type=user,shithouse is a very endearing coming of age story cooper raiff and dylan gelula were both great the story was very relatable im currently a senior in college and i felt a lot of the ways the protagonist felt my freshman year i appreciate how vulnerable the film was the film hits the beats that you would expect from this type of film but damn its just done so well the drama feels real and its also genuinely funny i thought ending felt a little too obvious and movie like but it did put a smile on face so i can forgive it overall i thoroughly enjoyed this this is just a great coming of age film i hope it becomes more popular than it is check it out
0,Blood on Her Name,96,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/blood_on_her_name/reviews?type=user,while the acting and direction are to be commended to label this film as a thriller is the worst kind of false advertising  the movie offers nothing to raise your pulse or inject any adrenaline to your system  if this is what you are looking for you will be severely disappointed  while they movie may have been quite good if simply labelled as a drama with all of the relevant expectations expecting a thriller destroys all of the positives that would have come from a slow methodical drama
1,Blood on Her Name,96,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/blood_on_her_name/reviews?type=user,hidden gem had never heard of this film watched it tonight very believable performance by the entire cast well written directed  filmed
2,Blood on Her Name,96,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/blood_on_her_name/reviews?type=user,the general premise is something thats been done many times before but theres a clever bit of writing that keeps you guessing as to how exactly things played out making you unsure of the main characters innocence and ratcheting up the tension its that coupled with a superb central performance from bethany anne lind that elevates blood on her name above what it should have been and leads to a satisfying little thriller set in the american south
3,Blood on Her Name,96,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/blood_on_her_name/reviews?type=user,very memorable this actress is really outstanding and the script is fabulous
4,Blood on Her Name,96,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/blood_on_her_name/reviews?type=user,meh  if you like watching a murderer do everything wrong then you will enjoy this movie  the actual plot is pretty dumb  our heroine is useless at covering up a crime  but the acting is good  i did care about the characters and wanted to see what would happen to them just barely
5,Blood on Her Name,96,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/blood_on_her_name/reviews?type=user,terrible how many plot holes and stretches can you make  everything seems fake shallow the main character is just a mess but without any nuance  i really wonder how this could be so praised the ending is so absolute bullcp i dont even have words stay away
6,Blood on Her Name,96,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/blood_on_her_name/reviews?type=user,the viewer is challenged in the debut feature from matthew pope  blood on her name will not stain the resume of pope  its a fantastic almost impossible to find at the moment thriller that is tense and paced wonderfully  you may or may not recognize a name or two in the cast but it doesnt matter  its short at 83 minutes but only a rare moment is wasted  find this  final score 8210
7,Blood on Her Name,96,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/blood_on_her_name/reviews?type=user,pretty good the acting is strong and the movie moves along at a great pace every movie now a days unjustly feels like it deserves to be some 3 hour epic so this 1h20m flew by which is definitely a plus
8,Blood on Her Name,96,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/blood_on_her_name/reviews?type=user,super fresh indie noir that manages to maintain a strong feeling of tension without leaning on genre cliches its a small film that packs a punch
9,Blood on Her Name,96,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/blood_on_her_name/reviews?type=user,about as unguessable as you can get as it ratchets the tension to excruciating levels starting in scene one which smacks you right over the head not a wasted second its a thought provoking dark tale of choices gone terribly wrong stellar acting with heart and emotion a southern gothic tragedy of the first order shakespeare would be proud
0,Birds of Prey (And the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn),78,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/birds_of_prey_2020/reviews?type=user,mediocre at best a lot of unnecessary flashbacks and a thin plot

3,Birds of Prey (And the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn),78,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/birds_of_prey_2020/reviews?type=user,mostly entertaining fun flashbacks bright colours good camera work however the fight scenes took me too long and the one in the funhouse was too silly to be good
4,Birds of Prey (And the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn),78,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/birds_of_prey_2020/reviews?type=user,"if i could fitremember the names of everyone who worked on this movie i would because they deserve all the praise in the world this is one of the best actioncomic book film ive watched in a while people with their preconceived prejudices didnt give it a fighting chance and what breaks my heart is that they just did not get it or harley quinn as a character people have problems with the narration and the timeline but if it were anything christopher nolan had made it would have been celebrated for ages the choppy timeline is because harley quinn is the narrator and she is crazy also her story her rules the costume design focuses on comfort and combat rather than closeup shots of butt and breasts the colourgrading is beautiful and the palette experiments with all kinds of contrasting hues the action sequences were grounded and clean instead of those 3d garbage were being served nowadays
if endgame got a 94 rt score and wonder woman got 93 even with the glaring error in the third act this at the very least deserves a 90 rt score 
to all the critiques calling this movie a movie with a feminist propaganda let me ask you did yall enjoy that girl power monstrosity at the climax of endgame which was not only nonsensical but also aimed at pandering to the audiences criticism of the franchise being too male dominated did you"

9,Birds of Prey (And the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn),78,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/birds_of_prey_2020/reviews?type=user,man i really wanted to like this movie i really did but the onenote oversaturation of fight scenes which were all great as standalones had me basically yawning before the film was even half over the anticipation of what i thought was an obvious buildup to the appearance of the joker at the climax was the cherry on top of an already overcooked letdown sundae

6,Shirley,87,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/shirley_2020/reviews?type=user,lying on the verge of simply pretensious and highly intellectual shirley threads between biopic and novel adaptation with ease revealing the work of an auspicious auteur  all the while relying on elisabeth moss stunning performance
7,Shirley,87,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/shirley_2020/reviews?type=user,every once in a while there is a movie like shirley where the critical acclaim is just baffling i think this movie has a cool visual style good performances and pretty much nothing else i didnt like the story and honestly have no idea what was going on during it maybe it was meant to be ambiguous which would have been fine if the movie wasnt so painfully boring this movie has been labeled as a thriller and it is anything but sure it made me uncomfortable often which i was okay with but it wasnt effective because of the bizarre and forgettable plot if i am being honest this is one of my least favorite films of 2020 so far and i know that is fairly unpopular
8,Shirley,87,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/shirley_2020/reviews?type=user,was really disappointed by this film as it has a great cast and a premise that is suggestively unsettling but the whole thing is too obvious and dull with all of the male characters painted as very one dimensional also found the way it was shot really irritating with an annoying filter making the whole thing feel needlessly over stylised am a fan of elizabeth moss but didnt enjoy her in this role
9,Shirley,87,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/shirley_2020/reviews?type=user,shirley seems to be attempting to be a psychological horror and a hearty oldworld drama at the same time but hardly traverses into either of those genres enough
0,Zappa,96,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/zappa_2020/reviews?type=user,i still dont think he was all that but definitely good for what he was and did
1,Zappa,96,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/zappa_2020/reviews?type=user,this movie is a fascinating overview of franks work and provides some insight into the uncompromising iconoclast that clearly was always pursuing the capture of the music he heard in his head over pursuit of any form of popular musical success
2,Zappa,96,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/zappa_2020/reviews?type=user,why is everyone treating this like a unique documentary created soley by winter the documentary simply splices together various existing interviews and concert footage or at least 90 of it is that being said it is what it is if youre a zappa fan you already know most of whats been presented even though there were only a few new nuggets i picked up it was enjoyable to see these previously filmed bits spliced together to create a new whole finally if youre a fan enough to notice that for instance certain albums and time periods were missed or gone over quickly what do you care youve seen them already
3,Zappa,96,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/zappa_2020/reviews?type=user,genios workaholics como zappa son pocos y muchos pasan inadvertidos este documental muestra la carrera de zappa el genio pero poco profundiza en frank es muy bueno porque muestra lo brillante que fue y todo lo que nos dejó pero poco dice sobre quien realmente fue en todo caso gran tributo al esplendoroso frank zappa
4,Zappa,96,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/zappa_2020/reviews?type=user,a nice in depth look into the amazing talent and life of frank zappa  i liked it
5,Zappa,96,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/zappa_2020/reviews?type=user,the theater staff while polite and apologetic was unable to show the movie that was advertised disappointing to say the least
6,Zappa,96,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/zappa_2020/reviews?type=user,"alex winter again shows his abilities as a documentary director i got the feeling while watching this that it was a work of a fan as well as one who greatly admires zappa and the massively significant figure he was and loves his music
the home videos and live video of him throughout his various stages of his development as a composer give the viewer a real sense of what he was like as a person a composer  musician and as a beloved artist we also see him as a loving father though one who had to be reminded at times in a way that he was a husband and father and not just a brilliant songwriter musician and performer i appreciate that they show as he really was a man driven by the sounds in his head and what he had to say but also as a taskmaster of sorts who was not exactly a warm friendly or forgiving person he even says at one point he has no friends outside of his family
the section on his significance to the czech people havel and his time there was smart to include as it shows very clearly the cultural significance he had for much of at least the west 
and finishing with a stellar version of watermelon in easter hay during the end credits was an excellent capper to a really fine documentary 4 stars"

2,Mank,83,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/mank/reviews?type=user,the great david fincher returns with mank his first film in 6 years its a movie about the disputed authorship of the legendary citizen kane screenplay at eats occasionally set in the 30s and early 40s it depicts hollywood struggling through the great depression with less and less people coming to the cinema and more and more people leaving the city altogether fincher directs with his usual panache and fine attention to details and gathers an ensemble cast to play so many characters that youll quickly lose track of them all the story behind the writing of citizen kane the consensus greatest film of all time is a fascinating tale and the answer to the question who did the majority of the work very much depends on who you ask some say mank did it all some say he and orson did half and half some say one did most of the writing and the other did the tweaking we see mank a chainsmoking alcoholic who seems simultaneously popular and unwelcome laid up in bed composing what would become his masterpiece unfortunately the film has a hard time keeping focus and spends most of the runtime detailing how much most of the characters dislike democratic politician upton sinclair something will be happening with the screenplay then itll fade to black and well get the same people complaining about sinclair and how condemning socialism and it takes ages to get back to the crux of the story i understand some historical context is important but it felt like the film was more about the election than it was about mank and his struggles to write anything the conflict between welles and mank happens in the last 15 minutes and very little material is dedicated to it its as if the film when on so many absurdly long asides that it lost track of time and had to tack on a hasty conclusion i loved gary oldmans performance which is both funny and deeply tragic and i had no trouble believing this was a real character but the film contains way too much dialogue a lot of which is both smug and selfcongratulatory it felt less like the screenwriters wanted to inform us about a period in history and more that they wanted to demonstrate how smart they were for knowing about it its got laughs great performances and doesnt shy away from showing us how troubled mank was and the consequences of his destructive behaviour but i found the focus on politics to be alienating and its abundance of clever dialogue to be merely irritating its beautifully made and sincerely acted but too often gets distracted by background details and showing off it how smart it is to really connect to its audience
3,Mank,83,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/mank/reviews?type=user,"beautifully shot and scored with a solid screenplay this film seemed to fly by as i didnt realize how totally immersed i was until it concluded the acting was top tier all around oldman and seyfried proving especially impressive i cant speak to how historically accurate the film is but i did appreciate the presentation style which advanced the plot using flashbacks presented as film scenes woven within the current time line

it definitely helped that i had recently watched citizen kane as well as many other classics as i completed the afi 100 this made many of the ancillary names and references instantly recognizable where they would not have been otherwise that is not to say mank cant be appreciated if you havent seen citizen kane or are totally unfamiliar with old hollywood but the experience here surely becomes richer with increased background knowledge"

9,Mank,83,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/mank/reviews?type=user,"gary oldman pulls that role off perfectly i was really impressed with how witty cutting and original it was
the dialogue was very clever orsons voice and presence was believable"
0,Ordinary Love,93,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/ordinary_love/reviews?type=user,a necessary story as we all have to deal with cancer at some point  lesley manville and liam neeson were both at the top of their games in this love story
1,Ordinary Love,93,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/ordinary_love/reviews?type=user,extremely naturalistic direction and tone makes the journey with cancer to be rooted in reality with reallife stakes touching performances by manville and neeson
2,Ordinary Love,93,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/ordinary_love/reviews?type=user,lesley manville and liam neeson shine in ordinary love a romantic comdram written brilliantly by owen mccafferty  its funny and its real and hubby and wife should know  we can tell you how accurate this is  this is authentic and its subtle and you can cry one moment and laugh the next  its hopeful and loving and beautiful and a sense of how tiny and magnificent life can be at the same time  we loved this and you will too if you believe in love and hope  life is complex but luckily this film is here to help  its a bizarre year but i havent seen a better 2020 performance than manville  this film was never released in the united states until 2020 so it should be up for awards consideration including hairstyling and makeup  hubby 90 wife  86 final average 8810
3,Ordinary Love,93,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/ordinary_love/reviews?type=user,wellacted the 2 leads terrific directed and written
4,Ordinary Love,93,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/ordinary_love/reviews?type=user,this movie shows a true relationship between a man and woman love is not a fairy tale it is tough raw happiness sadness hatred reconciliation and the closest friend you will ever have when god blesses that relationship ordained by god between a man and a woman
5,Ordinary Love,93,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/ordinary_love/reviews?type=user,although the theme was important to explore i found the pace a little too slow
6,Ordinary Love,93,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/ordinary_love/reviews?type=user,blah slow  didnt keep my interest
7,Ordinary Love,93,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/ordinary_love/reviews?type=user,ordinary love has two strong performances with an interesting yet predictable story liam neeson and lesley manville delivers great performances both are very strong here the story was interesting and kept me interested for the most part it felt very realistic and didnt seem to be over sentimental granted that means that what we watch is pretty slow i never felt really bored but the film did feel slow also there are some aspects i wouldve liked more detail on i wont get into it due to spoilers but the film is only and hour and a half and i think it couldve been longer overall this film was very good the two leads were absolutely great and the story kept me engaged this was a very solid film and i definitely recommend it 
8,Ordinary Love,93,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/ordinary_love/reviews?type=user,liam neeson and lesley manville are tom and joan a retired couple who have settled into an easy routine that couples who have been together for decades can their lives are in every sense ordinary the film is about how their relationship is tested when joan is diagnosed with breast cancer what makes this film work is that it gives a closeup view of life there is no complex plot here just the daytoday experiences of a married couple who are coping with a cancer diagnosis both actors are wonderful together but i thought that manvilles performance was superior one of the best so far this year she brought a lot of emotional breadth and depth to the role she was compelling in every scene particularly those that detail living through the diagnosis and chemotherapy thumbs up for an unexciting yet powerful story
9,Ordinary Love,93,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/ordinary_love/reviews?type=user,real life situation and how a couple handles it tough subject matter but this was very well done
